Dive into Sui's transformative journey, traversing the barriers of scalability and pioneering the fusion of Web2 and Web3, through this selection of videos featuring Sui experts.\n\nAdeniyi emphasizes that if scalability is fundamental for the future of blockchain, the overarching vision extends beyond. The aim is to amalgamate the strengths of Web2, primarily user experience, with the strengths of crypto, such as ownership rights, self-custody, agency, and asset programmability. However, realizing this promise has been hindered by various barriers related to blockchain technology. Sui's primary objective is to eliminate these barriers, allowing developers to seamlessly connect with users, meeting them at their level and streamlining the interaction between builders and consumers. Just as someone building a website doesn’t need to understand Amazon Web Services or worry about its ability to scale, Web3 builders shouldn’t be required to deal with infrastructural concerns unless they wish.\n\nSam and Logan delve into various aspects of Sui, exploring the Move programming language and pivotal features like zkLogin, while also touching upon Sui's scaling strategies for wider adoption. When asked what aspect of Sui people should be excited about, Sam presents a twofold response. Firstly, zkLogin stands out as a solution, offering a seamless single sign-on experience using familiar Web2 credentials. This development addresses a significant challenge for builders around user onboarding. Once this hurdle is cleared, the focus shifts to a broader question: \"What do you want to build?\" Builders are now empowered to create for a larger audience beyond the realm of existing crypto users.\n\nKostas highlights Sui's remarkable cryptographic adaptability. Instead of relying on a single cryptographic algorithm, Sui stands out by offering a range of cryptographic options, with potential for further additions down the line. This flexibility extends to wallet developers who can leverage multiple cryptographic algorithms, enabling wallet compatibility across diverse blockchain platforms, mobile device passkeys, and even email addresses via zkLogin. This diverse functionality, coupled with native multisig capabilities, paves the way for the creation of more powerful wallets. Sui's versatile cryptography isn't limited to wallet infrastructure but extends to broader applications like account abstraction, obfuscated NFTs, and social media platforms, among others.\n\nEvan sat down with Hub71 for a fireside chat discussing Sui's journey in the Web3 space and offering insights and advice for navigating this industry. When prompted about the future of the industry, Evan emphasized a crucial shift in perspective: instead of focusing on bringing more users to Web3, the focus should be on bringing Web3 to a broader user base. This change in approach, deeply rooted in Sui's philosophy, aims to create user experiences seamlessly embedded in Web3, where users engage without even recognizing they're in a Web3 environment.\n\nDuring the a16z Summer Research Seminars, George Danezis delves into Sui Lutris, the foundational distributed system protocol driving the Sui blockchain. His presentation thoroughly explores the lifecycle of a Sui transaction, detailing the interactions between users and infrastructure, including validators, in advancing a transaction. George discusses the evolution from Diem’s Fastpay to Sui's consensus-less transaction pathway, shedding light on the challenges encountered when reorienting Fastpay for broader applications found in Sui.\n\nAlonso delves into Sui's delegated proof-of-stake system, highlighting its commitment to preserving user control and ownership of staked SUI tokens. He details the reward calculation and distribution mechanisms for both validators and stakers. Alonso explores the evolution of staking within Sui, enhancing the security of both staking and the validator ecosystem through redesigned staking pool structures and the integration of native liquid staking. Additionally, he elaborates on the tokenomics that fuel staking rewards and discusses the intricate processes behind validator selection and management.\n\nBonus! Dive into content specifically crafted for those eager to commence their journey to build on Sui.\n\nShayan, in collaboration with the Encode Club team, delivers a comprehensive six-part video series introducing Sui, guiding viewers through the fundamentals and culminating in the development of a basic RPG game on the Sui platform.\n\nFor those seeking more, Mathew Jurenka, a member of the Sui community, has crafted an in-depth Sui Full Stack developer tutorial. This comprehensive video series offers step-by-step guidance on configuring a Sui developer environment and maximizing the utility of Sui infrastructure while constructing a full stack app on the platform.\n\nREAD NEXT\nThe Top 3 Mobile Wallets on Sui\nMobile wallets are crucial to increasing adoption and accessibility.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAY 15, 2024\n5 Games Coming to Sui: A Glimpse into the Future of Gaming\nNew gaming experiences are created on Sui and numerous games are launching this year!\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 22, 2024\nSui funds University Researchers from KAIST, UCL, National University of Singapore\nSui Academic Research Awards provides funding to 17 researchers pushing the boundaries of blockchain-related technologies.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 14, 2024\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

      "html": "Sui.io\nHome\nAbout\nContribute an Article\nSUI ECOSYSTEM\nRun Legends Uses Gamification to Get You Fit\nSui Foundation\nNov 17, 2023\n9 min\n\nJenny Xu, founder of Talofa Games, married her love of running with her love of games to help people enjoy working out\n\nWe recently had the opportunity to talk about game development with Jenny Xu, CEO and founder of Talofa Games, the studio behind the fitness game, Run Legends. With over one hundred games under her belt, she is no stranger to pushing the boundaries of what a game can be, and she has brought her inventiveness and storytelling prowess to her favorite sport, running. Hear about how she developed the concept behind Run Legends, her experience integrating digital assets on Sui into her game, and why she believes the mix of Web2 and Web3 can be a recipe for success.\n\nHow did you get into gaming? What led you to build Run Legends?\n\nI started building games when I was 12. I loved art and I loved drawing my favorite Pokemon, and that inspired me to make a bunch of fan games. I learned how to code because of games. From a very young age, I wanted to do game development. I put out about 100 games before I went to college, and out of those 100, I put about ten on the App Store, six of which did well. They got over 10 million downloads and helped pay for my college tuition. So that was a moment where I thought, wow, this is an actual career. \n\nI went to MIT to study computer science and also got recruited to the cross-country track and field team there. I was running a lot, like 70 miles a week. I had this love for fitness and game development. When I graduated early, there was a contest hosted by Niantic, the folks behind Pokemon GO that I entered with my dad. We were able to merge my favorite sport, running, with gaming and we ended up winning the whole thing. Then we worked on that prototype funded by Niantic for another year and a half. Eventually, we secured venture capital to produce the game we're working on now, Run Legends, which launched about six months ago. The game combines exercise with gaming, turning walking and running into a multiplayer RPG. People who play the game feel like they're not actually exercising but having fun, giving them extra motivation to go out and do something that they otherwise might not have done. \n\nJenny Xu, CEO and founder of Talofa Games\n\nWere your earlier games also in the fitness genre or were you testing out a variety of game types?\n\nMost of the games were in the horror genre. I made a lot of weird stuff. They were always experimental, things that pushed what a game could be, and played around with the definition of a game. That was exciting because it's fun to combine things I love. So I went from horror and games to, now, fitness and games.\n\nIn trying to push the idea of games forward, are you thinking more about storytelling or the tech? How did you conceive of this idea of redefining games?\n\nI'd say both. For instance, I once made a horror game where a girl was trapped in your computer. You saw her and talked to her, and when you didn't want to talk to her anymore and hit the quit button, she got really sad. And she'd ask, Are you sure you want to quit? Breaking the fourth wall so when you finally quit, it opens a YouTube video, indicating you might have closed the game client but now I've put myself into YouTube. Fun meta stuff like that. It was really exciting. That was tech plus storytelling. By nature, I’m a writer. Not a great one. But I like thinking about worlds and why characters behave as they do. \n\nIs story a prominent part of Run Legends?\n\nRun Legends is an interactive audio game. While you're walking and running, you're hearing a story unfold. It has the most dynamic story engine out of any game I've made because it narrates your fitness. It's got to be dynamic. It's got to be encouraging. I had to determine how to automate a coach walking somebody through a workout thousands of times. That was a really fun challenge, making a repeatable story and wrapping it around exercise. \n\nYou started making Run Legends during COVID, correct?\n\nLate 2021 to 2022 was really when Run Legends was fully forming. It was perfect timing because a lot of the world was thinking about how they needed to exercise more. How health is important. There was a new boom of running, and lots more people going outside, trying to work out when the gyms were closed. \n\nHow was the game originally conceptualized, both in story and in tech?\n\nRun Legends is a battle game. You fight monsters in fun battles that are comedic in nature. When you go fast, you can trigger certain skills, so maybe dealing damage, and then when you go slow, you can trigger another skill such as healing your team and also doing some damage. Players choose to go fast or slow in real life which controls the gameplay, and that makes them think less about the exercise and more about playing a video game they love. \n\nOn the technical side, there was a lot to figure out. How do we detect real-time speed pace changes? How do we ensure people have a seamless experience in outdoor settings where their data connection might be unstable? How do we recover when their connection completely drops out? And how do we keep people from running into trees? All of these challenges forced us to think outside of what game designers usually think about.\n\nScreens for the Run Legends app\n\nHow did you decide to use blockchain as part of your tech stack? Was it always part of the plan for the game?\n\nIt wasn’t initially part of the plan when we made the game. At the time we started building, 2021 and 2022, there were a lot of games in the fitness space that we're taking off in terms of usage, motivation, and people’s success stories. We started thinking about how to give people extra motivation to go outside beyond the game itself. An extrinsic motivation could be giving people money, which some apps do. But then you can also give people digital assets that can be equally as motivating. \n\nThat model works well with fitness, as it's a space where people inherently think of exercise as something they don't want to do. There's long been a monetary component tied to fitness, such as betting with friends, registering for expensive races, or getting money from insurance for going to the gym. We decided to learn a little bit more about blockchain in 2022, and are still learning now because it seemed like a really good fit for the type of game we're making. As we started looking into it, we met folks associated with Sui and learned they had a lot of the same ideas as us about how the future of gaming was blockchain. \n\nHow do you incorporate blockchain features into Run Legends? \n\nOur game is Web2-focused in the sense that somebody playing doesn't realize that it has anything to do with blockchain. It's optional for players to understand that part of it. But if they care about it, they get free items in the game that can be exported and traded with others. Items in our game are characters you play. So if you're into long-distance running, maybe a certain character is best for you, but if you're not into that, you can give it to someone else. Everyone has a different style of fitness so inherently there's some value in trading. \n\nRight now we're doing the Bullshark Quest 3. Every time a player defeats an enemy, there's an on-chain transaction to upgrade the gear or the character that killed that enemy. It’s a fun but small challenge to see how strong a player’s character can get over time. And we're letting people trade those characters after the event is over. It’s cool seeing how characters can accrue power through endgame activity. \n\nWe’re using pretty basic things for now. We use sponsored transactions through Shinami so players don't have to pay any gas while playing. I like that a lot. As somebody who comes more from the gaming world, one of the biggest pain points of blockchain gaming is the moment you're asked to create a wallet, sign a transaction, or pay fees without understanding why. Having experiences where the game surprises you with a reward is what we're going for. We hope to use dynamic attributes in the future. We kind of use it through the level-up system, but not as much as we're planning.\n\nHow do you think Run Legends compares to games that don't incorporate the engagement aspects enabled by blockchain? Is your community having a positive reaction to the digital assets rewards? Can you tell if it incentivizes continued use of your game?\n\nA lot of our most passionate players are people we found in the Sui community who love the way this game is developing. How there's a gradual ramp of more and more things we can do with Sui. And I think for players that aren't as familiar with it, they've mentioned how pleasantly surprised they are with our integration of blockchain, and that it’s not being forced on them if they don't want it. In that sense, both sides have felt very positive, which to us is a win, because we didn't want to alienate anyone. We’re glad to have that slow on-ramp, allowing us to really listen to player feedback, monitor how people are playing, and cut out bad actors early on. It's been really good for us to have this learning process. And players notice. They mention how our dev team is always available to chat and we're friendly. I'm proud of our team in that aspect. \n\nYou're involved in mentoring other game developers. How do you approach the mentorship process?\n\nI have gotten mentorship from a lot of people in the industry so I give back by sharing my experience openly. At conferences like GDC or DICE, I’ll meet both mentors and mentees. I'm definitely in the phase where I take more than I give, but I do love to help. Having run a VC-backed startup, it's nice to share that experience and tell others what helped us when we were raising. I can talk about some of the challenges we had launching with a blockchain aspect and some of the upsides to doing that. \n\nI think people relate a lot more to stories. So when they see that I’m a relatable person, they think, I could also get into this. Or they've heard so many bad things about the industry and then I tell them my experience, and they think, maybe I should give this another try.  \n\nWhat are your thoughts on the evolution of physical-digital games like Run Legends? \n\nThe fitness category of games is still pretty narrow. Its roots started a while ago. Pokémon GO and Zombies Run are some of our biggest inspirations and they've been around for about 10 years at this point. The category isn’t new, but there is not as much activity as in, say, shooter games. Fitness games kind of fall into the education game space, where it's something that somebody doesn't want to do and you're trying to get them to do it. The gamification industry is getting better and better every year because more and more people are playing games. Gen Z is a generation of 87 percent gamers. I think because of that, every year more people are trying out things that resemble games. And if the games are trying to get them to do something good, like work out, there's a way higher chance of people trying that these days than 10 years ago. That gives me a lot of hope for games like ours. And obviously, new tech makes it more accurate. There are way more hardware products that can track your heart rate, speed, and other physical metrics. So it's a very exciting time. I think we'll see a lot more of this stuff in the future.\n\nSpeaking of the future, what should we expect to see next with Run Legends?\n\nThere's a pretty big feature coming in the next month or so, where we're going to have a pretty cool progressive map system. And we have a cool trailer coming out soon as well. We're excited about that. The last piece is just more exercise types and more accessibility, being able to make Run Legends a game that everyone plays every day, whether it's to get their walk, their run, or some other sort of wellness. We're testing and experimenting with that as a way to get more users to try it out. So look out for new game features, new exercise types, and a new shiny trailer!\n\nREAD NEXT\nThe Top 3 Mobile Wallets on Sui\nMobile wallets are crucial to increasing adoption and accessibility.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAY 15, 2024\n5 Games Coming to Sui: A Glimpse into the Future of Gaming\nNew gaming experiences are created on Sui and numerous games are launching this year!\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 22, 2024\nSui funds University Researchers from KAIST, UCL, National University of Singapore\nSui Academic Research Awards provides funding to 17 researchers pushing the boundaries of blockchain-related technologies.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 14, 2024\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

Consisting of a Sui-based smart contract and a backend service pulling weather data from the OpenWeather API, anyone can integrate weather data into their app.\n\nThe Sui Weather Oracle provides information such as temperature, humidity, and wind for any of its supported cities. The oracle can be used by other smart contracts or applications that need reliable and decentralized weather information for various purposes, such as travel, insurance, agriculture, gambling, or gaming.\n\nThe Sui Weather Oracle enables weather tracking and other apps using OpenWeather API data.\n\nHowever, using weather for its randomness presents an intriguing use case. Weather is one of the most unpredictable and complex phenomena in nature. Weather forecasters do an admirable job of predicting rain or sunny skies, for the most part, but the minutiae, such as specific temperatures or wind speeds, is beyond the current science to nail down. \n\nAs a fundamental concept in many fields of science, mathematics, and engineering, randomness can be used to generate secure cryptographic keys, test hypotheses, or simulate complex systems. However, generating true randomness is not easy, as most physical or computational processes are deterministic or biased in some way. Using weather data as an oracle input provides random outputs that are uniformly distributed and independent of any previous output.\n\nOracle data in apps\n\nOracles on Sui and other blockchains serve as conduits to offchain data, including sports scores, stock prices, and weather. Displaying this data directly in an app, the most obvious use, lets builders create stock portfolio management tools, weather trackers, and real-time football rankings. Data usage in this manner can become more complex, of course, with apps using sports scores to inform fantasy leagues as one example. \n\nGames may be based directly on oracle data. For example, an oracle can provide the odds and outcomes of various wagers for contests such as sports matches, political elections, or lottery draws. The players can then place bets on the outcomes based on the odds provided by the oracle. \n\nThings get more interesting when builders use oracles offering unpredictable data to generate randomness. For example, an oracle can use real-world events, such as weather data, sports results, or stock prices, to create random outcomes for a game. Alternatively, an oracle can use cryptographic methods, such as hash functions or digital signatures, to produce random numbers that are secure and provable. The fact that the oracle data comes from a verifiable source independent from the app makes the randomness outcomes trustworthy.\n\nWeather data can be used as a seed for randomness to determine the results of character actions in a game. (Image source: RPGMaker)\n\nRandomness based on unpredictable data from an oracle could be incorporated into game mechanics. For example, in a roleplaying game, an oracle can determine the success or failure of a character's action, such as casting a spell, hacking a computer, or persuading an NPC. The oracle can also affect the game world, such as changing the weather, spawning enemies, or triggering events. The game can use the oracle's data to create a fair and consistent randomness that is not influenced by the game developer or the player.\n\nThe Sui Weather Oracle\n\nOracles will enable a new generation of apps on Sui, bridging real-world data to its high-performance platform. Given the accessibility of the OpenWeather API and the usefulness of its data, a weather oracle makes for a good addition to Sui. \n\nUse cases\n\nThe Sui Weather Oracle is useful for many applications that require weather data, such as:\n\nRandomness: Weather data can be used as a source of randomness for various purposes, such as generating random numbers, selecting winners, or creating unique NFTs. For example, a random number generator. can use the temperature, humidity, or wind speed of a specific location at a specific time as a seed.\nBetting and gaming: Apps can use Sui Weather Oracle data to enable weather prediction wagers, weather-themed games, or weather-based rewards. For example, a game could let users bet on a city's weather, or an app could offer users NFTs based on the weather of different locations.\nOther use cases: Apps for insurance, travel, education, or research could use weather data. For example, apps could factor in weather data to calculate the risk of natural disasters, plan a travel itinerary, teach students about weather patterns, or aid in setting up scientific experiments.\nStructure\n\nThe Sui Weather Oracle, delivering up-to-date weather information for over 1,000 cities across the globe, consists of three components: an external service, an internal service, and a smart contract. The external service, the OpenWeather API, provides current weather data from various sources. The internal service is the weather oracle back-end, which fetches the weather data from the OpenWeather API every 10 minutes and updates the weather conditions for each city. The smart contract is the Sui Weather Oracle contract, which stores the weather data on the Sui blockchain and lets users access it in a secure and transparent manner. Users can also leverage the weather data for various decentralized applications that rely on the weather, such as gaming.\n\nEarning storage rebates\n\nThe Sui Weather Oracle mitigates the cost of storing its real-time data on the network through the storage rebate mechanism. Sui supports onchain storage in its infrastructure and tokenomics model by adding a storage fee to its gas fees. The fund created from storage fees helps reimburse network operators for maintaining the hardware to store data and process transactions. As a means of keeping the quantity of onchain data under control, deleting onchain data renders a storage fund rebate. \n\nThe Sui Weather Oracle stores and updates the weather data on the blockchain. The admin pays a one-time fee to create the initial list of CityWeatherOracle objects, and receives a rebate for updating the weather data for each city. The rebate is proportional to the amount of data updated, and the frequency of updates. This way, the admin can store and update the weather data on the blockchain at a low cost.\n\nLeveraging Sui Object Display\n\nThe Sui Weather Oracle uses the Sui Object Display standard to dynamically update the icon for each city based on the current weather condition, showing rain clouds or a sun, for example. The Sui Object Display standard is a template engine that allows the onchain management of the offchain display for any type of object. It uses a template string that can be substituted with the data of the object, such as the weather ID of the city. The offchain display is handled by a back-end service that serves an icon for each one of the supported cities to the Sui explorer. The icon is chosen from a predefined set of icons that represent different weather conditions, such as sunny, cloudy, rainy, and snowy.\n\nThe Sui Object Display standard can be leveraged to serve icons representing different weather conditions. (Image by coolvector on Freepik)\nSui Weather Oracle smart contract \n\nThe Sui Weather Oracle smart contract provides real-time and historical weather data for over 1,000 locations around the world and supports minting weather NFTs based on the weather data of a city. The smart contract also uses the Sui Object Display standard, enabling the dynamic and customizable display of the weather data and the weather NFTs on the blockchain. The smart contract has four main functions: add_city, remove_city, update, and mint. \n\nThe oracle::weather module defines the following:\n\nAdminCap, a struct that represents the administrator capability of the oracle owner.\n\nstruct AdminCap has key, store { id: UID }\n\nWEATHER, a struct that sets up a Publisher.\n\nstruct WEATHER has drop {}\n\nWeatherOracle, a struct, represents the oracle itself. It has fields id, address, name, and description that store the oracle's identifier, owner's address, name, and description respectively.\n\nstruct WeatherOracle has key {\n    id: UID,\n    address: address,\n    name: String,\n    description: String,\n}\n\nCityWeatherOracle, a struct that represents the weather data for a specific city. It has fields id, geoname_id, name, country, latitude, positive_latitude, longitude, positive_longitude, weather_id, temp, pressure, humidity, visibility, wind_speed, wind_deg, wind_gust, clouds, and dt that store the city's unique ID, geoname ID, name, country, latitude, longitude, weather ID, temperature, pressure, humidity, visibility, wind speed, wind direction, wind gust, cloudiness, and timestamp respectively.\n\nstruct CityWeatherOracle has key, store {\n    id: UID,\n    geoname_id: u32,\n    name: String,\n    country: String,\n    latitude: u32,\n    positive_latitude: bool,\n    longitude: u32,\n    positive_longitude: bool,\n    weather_id: u16,\n    temp: u32,\n    pressure: u32,\n    humidity: u8,\n    visibility: u16,\n    wind_speed: u16,\n    wind_deg: u16,\n    wind_gust: Option<u16>,\n    clouds: u8,\n    dt: u32\n}\n\nAn init function that initializes the contract during the deployment, creating a new instance of WeatherOracle and sharing it publicly, and creating a new instance of AdminCap and transferring it to the sender.\n\nfun init(otw: WEATHER, ctx: &mut TxContext) {\n    package::claim_and_keep(otw, ctx);\n\n    let cap = AdminCap { id: object::new(ctx) };\n    transfer::share_object(WeatherOracle {\n        id: object::new(ctx),\n        address: tx_context::sender(ctx),\n        name: string::utf8(b\"SuiMeteo\"),\n        description: string::utf8(b\"A weather oracle for posting weather updates (temperature, pressure, humidity, visibility, wind metrics and cloud state) for major cities around the world. Currently the data is fetched from https://openweathermap.org.

Use it at your own risk and discretion.\"),\n    });\n    transfer::public_transfer(cap, tx_context::sender(ctx));\n}\n\nThe add_city public function, which lets the owner of the AdminCap add a new city to the oracle service by providing its geoname_ID, name, country, latitude, and longitude.

The Sui Weather Oracle provides real-time weather data, such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed, for different cities around the world. The city_weather_oracle_temp function retrieves the temperature of a city in Kelvin multiplied by 1,000, given its geoname_ID.\n\nFor example, the following code retrieves the current temperature of Paris, France (2988507):\n\nuse oracle::weather::{WeatherOracle};\n\nfun get_temp(weather_oracle: &WeatherOracle): u32 {\n    let geoname_id = 2988507; // Paris, France\n    oracle::weather::city_weather_oracle_temp(weather_oracle, geoname_id)\n}\nBridging data to Sui\n\nThe rise of big data over the last few decades has created vast repositories representing all manner of real world phenomenon and activity, from ocean currents to traffic flows in Manhattan. Responsible use of this data results in apps that make a positive impact on people's lives, whether it's helping predict forest fire danger or making popular concert tickets available in a fair distribution. \n\nThe spread of oracles on Sui will increase the relevance of apps to people's daily lives, making the network an indispensable part of modern digital infrastructure.\n\nREAD NEXT\nLet's Move Sui Helps Developers who want to Move on Sui\nThose wanting to learn Move programming now have a fun and intuitive option with the launch of Let's Move Sui!\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 12, 2024\nAll About Smart Contracts\nIn their simplest form, smart contracts govern transactions, but the Sui Move programming language opens the possibility for much more sophisticated apps.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAUG 30, 2023\nAll About Kiosks\nThe Kiosk primitive on Sui lets builders quickly set up shops and sell digital assets, enforcing policies such as royalties that automatically collect fees for content creators.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAUG 23, 2023\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

      "html": "Sui.io\nHome\nAbout\nContribute an Article\nMOVE\nOrange Comet Leverages Sui Kiosk for Game Items and IP Protection\nSui Foundation\nDec 8, 2023\n4 min\n\nWith The Walking Dead Lands, Orange Comet makes use of Sui's kiosk primitive and other features to power a top-tier video game.\n\nAs Orange Comet works with AMC to develop NFTs and a game based on The Walking Dead series, protecting AMC's intellectual property is a paramount concern. Leveraging Sui's Kiosk primitive not only let Orange Comet reassure AMC that its assets would be safe, but opened up a world of capabilities for the upcoming The Walking Dead Lands game.\n\nKiosk, a primitive on Sui, gives builders the tools to create shops where they can distribute NFTs. More importantly, builders can set conditions in the Kiosk for the NFTs, such as royalties that are automatically paid to the NFT creator on each subsequent resale. Given the equivalence between NFTs and objects on Sui, an NFT could be a playable character in a game, a character's item, a ticket to a concert, or even a property title.\n\n\"The Move programming language lets me do just about anything I want,\" said Orange Comet CTO Peter Morales, \"but having standards, such as Kiosk, makes it easier for engineers to work together.\"\n\nThe Walking Dead Lands will let players explore the desolate, walker-infested world of AMC's hit show.\n\nOrange Comet's leadership team boasts a mix of extensive experience in both entertainment, AAA gaming development, and technology. The company leverages this experience to extend the reach of popular entertainment properties onto the blockchain. Orange Comet showed early interest in Sui, developing expertise and engaging with it during Devnet, and launching the Degens and Dragons project to test Sui's features. \n\nFrom NFTs to games\n\nWhen Orange Comet formed three years ago, NFTs were a hot commodity and a natural fit to help studios enter the blockchain space. With The Walking Dead Lands, the company wanted to move beyond NFTs and give people a playable experience. As CTO, Peter decided on Sui as a solution for the gaming element due to its speed and scalability. \n\nThe Walking Dead Lands game lets players control an avatar in the decimated, zombie-ridden land portrayed in the AMC television series. The game is a third-person shooter, with the player viewpoint from behind and just above the avatar. Walkers dot the land and players can kill them with a variety of weapons, resulting in visually grisly deaths. \n\nBuilt on Sui, player avatars and accessories will exist as objects on the network. Players will be able to equip their characters and use these objects according to the Kiosk policies created by Orange Comet.\n\nAs a role-playing game, players can obtain a variety of equipment, some of which they buy from in-game stores. Those stores leverage Sui's Kiosk primitive, which gave Peter's engineering team a framework on which to build. \"We love working on the blockchain and developing smart contracts,\" said Peter, \"but at the end of the day we're video game developers, and that's what we want to spend most of our time doing. Not having to build stores from scratch let us focus on things like graphics and gameplay.\"\n\nGaming on-chain\n\n\"Pretty much everything you interact with in the world, the items you collect, purchase, and modify, are backed up on-chain,\" said Peter. The team used the composability of objects on Sui to give players rich inventories and item options. At the same time, they were able to ensure the integrity of AMC's intellectual property, enforcing rules to prevent misuse. The game can present the world of The Walking Dead without being as confined as a traditional video game.\n\nAlong with Sui, which supports the game's assets and distribution, the team built the game on Unreal engine. This choice gives it rich video, robust physics, and the kind of action people expect from a top tier game. \n\nThe Walking Dead universe makes a great background for a video game, and Sui provides the features to deliver an accessible experience with riveting gameplay.\n\nAs games require randomness to achieve fair results for players, the developer team leveraged Sui's Verifiable Random Function (VRF) and its support for the Drand randomness beacon. Similar to Kiosk, VRF is a primitive on Sui that let the team build on an existing framework. VRF lets players discover randomly determined items as they work their way through the world, ensuring a bit of variety and replayability.\n\nThe Walking Dead Lands will also feature sponsored transactions, another Sui feature, so players don't have to pay gas fees as they explore the world. However, as player avatars interact with items, the number of transactions on the network will multiply. Peter pointed out that, to avoid the game getting too expensive to run, the team is working on programmable transaction blocks, which let them essentially bundle many transactions from the game, greatly controlling costs.\n\nBuilding an ecosystem\n\nOrange Comet's extensive connections within the entertainment industry give it great potential for bringing more studio content, in one form or another, to Sui. Peter envisions an Orange Comet gaming ecosystem that encourages loyalty. For example, players who acquire assets in one game may be rewarded with equivalent assets in another. Kiosk plays an important role here, as it manages player inventories on-chain and verifies the pedigree of their items. \n\nSui creates the potential for game developers to set up ecosystems similar to the Steam platform, giving players a dashboard that includes all the available games from a publisher. The ecosystem can include incentives to try different games, and make onboarding easy through sponsored transactions and zkLogin, Sui's new primitive supporting Web2 authorization services.\n\nREAD NEXT\nLet's Move Sui Helps Developers who want to Move on Sui\nThose wanting to learn Move programming now have a fun and intuitive option with the launch of Let's Move Sui!\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 12, 2024\nAll About Smart Contracts\nIn their simplest form, smart contracts govern transactions, but the Sui Move programming language opens the possibility for much more sophisticated apps.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAUG 30, 2023\nAll About Kiosks\nThe Kiosk primitive on Sui lets builders quickly set up shops and sell digital assets, enforcing policies such as royalties that automatically collect fees for content creators.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAUG 23, 2023\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

      "html": "Sui.io\nHome\nAbout\nContribute an Article\nDEFI\nHow Settlement Time and Composability Help DeFi Flourish on Sui\nSui Foundation\nDec 19, 2023\n5 min\n\nSui offers short settlement times and broad composability, supporting the construction of better DeFi products.\n\nSui's decentralized finance (DeFi) success comes down to unique elements of the platform. Two of these core elements, settlement time and composability, not only grant DeFi protocols on Sui a competitive edge but also ensure unparalleled user experiences and development opportunities. \n\nSettlement timing, a metric based on Sui's transaction processing model, ensures DeFi users see near-immediate results for transactions. Composability, deeply ingrained in Sui's programming environment, extends its reach to both objects and smart contracts. Sui’s deep composability empowers DeFi builders to introduce innovative products, setting themselves apart from DeFi apps on other blockchains. \n\nWith over 20 DeFi protocols launched within Sui Mainnet's first six months, these distinctive Sui-specific features have become a cornerstone for DeFi innovation.\n\nFrom finality to settlement\n\nDeFi often faces usability challenges due to communication overhead within the underlying network, leading to significant transaction confirmation delays. Waiting 10 minutes, or even 30 seconds, for transaction confirmation falls short for many DeFi use cases. Despite notable advancements in reducing transaction latency with proof-of-stake technology, most blockchains struggle to achieve the minimal latency required to compete effectively with Web2 applications.\n\nWhen discussing transaction completion, it's important to distinguish between transaction finality and settlement. Time to finality (TTF) denotes the period for a transaction to become non-reversible and eventually recorded onchain. However, TTF does not assure successful transaction execution; the transaction might fail and be recorded as unsuccessful. Settlement time is a clearer metric to gauge a blockchain's transaction latency. One step beyond TTF, settlement time refers to the duration for transaction execution and its outcome to be recorded onchain. It marks the moment users retrieve the actual transaction result, representing the actual latency experienced when submitting a transaction.\n\nFinality and settlement on Sui\n\nOn Sui, the settlement path of a transaction hinges on the object types involved. Sui's transaction processing model lets owned objects follow the fast path, while those involving shared objects require consensus validation. Despite the path taken, TTF remains consistent at approximately 400 milliseconds. Owned object transactions also achieve settlement at this point. However, shared object transactions require consensus validation, pushing settlement time to 2 to 3 seconds.\n\nThe settlement time of an owned object transaction is as fast it's time to finality, while shared object transactions experience slightly longer settlement times.\n\nHighlighting the importance of defining 'finality,' especially in Layer 2 contexts, it's crucial to note the varied interpretations. In some instances, finality within Layer 2 frameworks refers to the initial transaction finalization with a sequencer before settling into an external network. However, on Sui, a Layer 1 blockchain, settlement stands as an absolute process, completely independent of any external network or additional infrastructure.\n\nBlockchain settlement times vary widely across the industry, from fractions of a second to as long as thirty minutes. However, for most DeFi applications, a consistently fast settlement time is paramount. Surprisingly, certain blockchains, despite boasting low TTF, might still exhibit considerably longer settlement times. This duration directly impacts users and, if overly burdensome, can deter app usage.\n\nOn Sui, developers can creatively leverage owned object transactions, fostering the creation of projects with exceptionally low latency. Faster settlement times not only enhance the DeFi user experience but, when combined with robust composability, provide developers the flexibility to execute complex operations swiftly.\n\nComposability\n\nComposability underscores the capacity of software to seamlessly integrate with other systems, reducing reliance on inherent trust. Enabling developers to easily interact with various apps is crucial for inventing new mechanisms and products. Sui drives composability across two important levels of the developer stack: one for objects and data, and another for apps and contracts.\n\nData and object composability\n\nSui provides the flexibility for developers to define new object types tailored to encapsulate necessary data fields for their intended use. Once established, these object types gain network-wide recognition, ensuring seamless interaction with an object's data across various applications. This foundational focus on object-centricity within Sui paves a clear path for data and object composability.\n\nSui emphasizes explicit ownership in its objects, allowing for the easy establishment of hierarchical relationships by linking objects to others. Beyond this, enhanced capabilities arise from an object's ability to reference another object's data. However, direct object referencing through an object field necessitates including all referenced objects in the transaction, regardless of their relevance.\n\nTo address this challenge, Sui introduces a dynamic method that enables object incorporation without incurring gas fees for unnecessary objects in transactions. Through dynamic fields, applications or users selectively specify the required objects for reference in a transaction. This innovative development environment significantly optimizes gas usage, fostering greater gas efficiency and a better user experience for DeFi apps.\n\nApp and contract composability\n\nWhile data and object composability is extremely important, enabling applications to interact with others in a composable manner is equally as vital. Despite the facilitation by object composability, app builders encounter additional requirements, notably the need for atomicity.\n\nAtomicity signifies executing a series of transactions either entirely without interruption or not at all. This quality is especially valuable for processes involving multiple transactions across different apps. Ensuring that if any transaction within the sequence fails, the entire transaction path reverts is pivotal for maintaining consistency. Sui addresses this need through programmable transaction blocks (PTBs).\n\nPTBs play a pivotal role in establishing atomic composability among applications within Sui. Transactions within a PTB execute sequentially but finalize only when the entire sequence concludes, ensuring atomic execution. Presently, a single PTB can accommodate up to 1,024 unique operations in a single execution. Contrarily, a traditional blockchain would execute 1,024 separate transactions consecutively, resulting in a cumbersome development experience and significant gas requirements.\n\nPTBs serve multiple purposes beyond achieving atomic composability. For instance, minting and distributing numerous NFTs simultaneously can be efficiently executed through a PTB, significantly reducing gas usage. \n\nThe integration of PTBs in DeFi apps provides a transformative advantage, reducing transaction costs and enabling comprehensive operations in a unified sequence. By consolidating multiple transactions into a single cohesive unit, PTBs allow for significant optimization of gas usage within Sui’s DeFi environment. This consolidation allows for increased efficiency while empowering developers with greater capabilities, marking a significant stride in DeFi evolution.\n\nExpanding the DeFi universe\n\nThese qualities of finality, settlement, and composability underscore the intricate web of elements shaping the landscape of DeFi and Sui's transformative role within it. As the future of DeFi evolves, crucial protocol-layer elements such as network fee dynamics, scalable throughput, and account abstraction give developers the tools to bring greater innovation and efficiency to their protocols.\n\nAlthough many DeFi activities fall along well-understood yield-earning mechanisms, developers can use Sui's intrinsic features to fine-tune the elements underlying the protocols. Leveraging composability to minimize fees and delivering settlement in record time can give new DeFi uses, with expectations created in traditional financial platforms, a satisfying experience encouraging onboarding and continued use. \n\nSign up for Sui's monthly developer newsletter to keep informed about the newest Move and Sui developments.\n\nREAD NEXT\nFirst Digital Stablecoin Debuting on Sui\nFDUSD, a stablecoin previously only offered on Ethereum and BNB Chain, expands its horizons on Sui.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 11, 2024\nDeepBook Previews Token Launch with NFT Airdrop\nDeepBook NFT recipients will be able to claim the DEEP token when it launches.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 2, 2024\nSolend Team Launches New DeFi Protocol Suilend\nThe team behind the most popular lending protocol on Solana brings its expertise to Sui.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 11, 2024\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

      "html": "Sui.io\nHome\nAbout\nContribute an Article\nDEFI\nBluefin Relies on Sui Performance For First Class DeFi\nSui Foundation\nJan 10, 2024\n5 min\n\nSui's network performance and user onboarding features helped Bluefin's DeFi platform log billions in volume.\n\nBluefin's founders wanted to offer advanced, capitally efficient derivatives trading on a decentralized platform competitive with anything in the traditional finance sector. The platform would need to be performant, inexpensive, and accessible to serve both institutional and individual users.\n\nA beta launch in 2023 on Arbitrum, a layer 2 network built on Ethereum, helped the Bluefin team see the potential of its DeFi vision and gain a better understanding of the technology. The Bluefin Classic platform gained users who traded over $2.1 Billion over the course of the year.  However, the team recognized limits to what it could accomplish on Arbitrum.\n\nExploring options, Bluefin found that Sui could not only meet its technical performance requirements, but also deliver a user experience unlike any other in the blockchain industry. In addition, Sui's transaction processing fees would be a fraction of those on other blockchains.\n\n\"From the start, we wanted to put user experience first for both institutional and retail users within decentralized finance, something we saw lacking in the industry and a great opportunity,\" said Bluefin co-founder Rabeel Jawaid.\n\nBluefin v2 launched on Sui in the last quarter of 2023, with performance and an interface designed for both Web3 and Web2 users.\n\nWith its next iteration, Bluefin v2, the company developed and launched a platform on Sui offering exceptionally quick trades and a seamless account creation process. Despite a launch in the last quarter of 2023, Bluefin v2 logged over $3.2 billion in trading volume in December alone, with over 80 percent market share in the ecosystem.\n\nDerivatives demand \n\nAmong the many DeFi services available, Bluefin sees derivatives trading as the largest use case for crypto. Unlike a direct swap, derivatives traders agree to purchase a specific cryptocurrency amount at a set price sometime in the future, essentially making a bet on whether the token will increase or decrease in value. \n\nTraders may enter into a set contract or pay for an option to buy the token at a specific price. With the former, a trader would gain value if the token increased in value. Under an option agreement, the trader can decline to purchase the token if its value decreased below the set option price. \n\nPerpetual contracts, a recent addition at Bluefin, let traders enter a contract to buy a cryptocurrency at a set price with no specific end date. In these contracts, a trader who expects an increase in value, called going long, would want to sell when the token rises above their purchase price. Other traders may buy into a perpetual contract with an expectation the token will lose value, called going short. Each side of this trading equation pays a funding rate to maintain their position.\n\nMilliseconds matter\n\nDerivatives trading became popular in cryptocurrency markets due to users being able to go long and short, take on leverage, and deploy their capital more efficiently, such as using the same collateral to go long on Bitcoin and short on Ethereum. They are also significantly more liquid and have cheaper fees on most exchanges. However, only recently have blockchains offered the performance to support derivatives.\n\nOver December, 2023, Bluefin users typically traded over $100 million per day, with some notable spikes rising much higher. (Source: Def\n\n\"Derivatives trading in DeFi requires high-performance blockchains and no decentralized protocol has yet matched the success of a leading centralized exchange because of the user experience challenges with onchain trading,\" said Rabeel. \"We’re going to change that, and Sui enables us to do so.\"\n\nBluefin found that Sui meets its performance needs in two key metrics: transactions per second (TPS) and trade confirmation timing. Where TPS on other chains becomes a bottleneck during high volume trading, Sui handled 5,414 TPS in 2023 without hitting its theoretical or practical limit. Equally as important, Bluefin can give an optimistic confirmation of transactions in 30 milliseconds and finalize transactions in about 550 milliseconds. Each of these metrics meets the expectations of traditional finance platform users.\n\nBluefin v2 processes transactions quickly, leading to impressive DeFi volume.\n\nLetting traders conclude transactions in a timely manner is just half the battle. \"A major step towards achieving scale on Bluefin is the elimination of the need for wallets,\" said Rabeel, \"which aligns with our goal of emulating a Web2 trading experience while retaining the decentralization benefits of an on-chain protocol.\"\n\nBluefin leveraged Sui's zkLogin primitive to seamlessly bring new DeFi users onboard. Although existing DeFi users can begin trading on Bluefin by connecting a wallet, the platform gives people the option of creating an account through their Google or Apple login credentials. As a primitive on Sui, zkLogin does not depend on a middleman, which would increase costs and create a security risk. zkLogin uses zero-knowledge proofs to verify a user's identity without requiring Bluefin to store IDs or passwords.\n\nBluefin leverages zkLogin to seamlessly onboard users through their existing accounts on trusted services.\n\nAs the icing on Bluefin's DeFi cake, Sui's consistently low transaction fees further served its users. As an axiom similar to buy low, sell high, traders seek the lowest fees for their activities, as fees eat into capital that could be put to better use. Transaction fees on Bluefin v2 are coming in at below $0.005 per trade. Arbitrum's base fee comes in at 1 GWEI, equivalent to $0.005, and rises with network demand, penalizing users as transactions increase. Sui's scalable architecture means that these fees do not rise as traffic increases, supporting Bluefin's high volume users.\n\nFuture forward\n\nAlthough Bluefin v2 showed stellar performance in its short existence, the company plans to make it even better. Currently, it uses shared objects on Sui, which require consensus to achieve finality. Bluefin is redesigning its architecture so that all trades between parties will use owned objects in a trusted transaction, bypassing consensus to resolve as quickly as possible. \n\n\"We’ve benchmarked these trades to take about 400 milliseconds onchain to finalize,\" said Rabeel, \"and coupled with a redesign of our offchain orderbook to intelligently partition trade submissions by users, we expect to reach up to 30,000 parallel trades per second of unique users before experiencing any delays in execution.\"\n\nBeyond infrastructure updates, Bluefin wants to make its user experience even better. \"Within the next few weeks, users will be able to land on our exchange, use Google to create an account, walk through a bridge to deposit funds, and start trading seamlessly,\" said Rabeel.\n\nFuture offerings will include the exchange's BLUE token and access to spot markets through DeepBook, Sui's first native liquidity layer. With such a strong start in late 2023, Bluefin's path looks bright in 2024.\n\nREAD NEXT\nFirst Digital Stablecoin Debuting on Sui\nFDUSD, a stablecoin previously only offered on Ethereum and BNB Chain, expands its horizons on Sui.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 11, 2024\nDeepBook Previews Token Launch with NFT Airdrop\nDeepBook NFT recipients will be able to claim the DEEP token when it launches.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 2, 2024\nSolend Team Launches New DeFi Protocol Suilend\nThe team behind the most popular lending protocol on Solana brings its expertise to Sui.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 11, 2024\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

      "html": "Sui.io\nHome\nAbout\nContribute an Article\nDEFI\nSui Closes in on 6,000 TPS as Inscriptions Surge\nSui Foundation\nJan 5, 2024\n3 min\n\nSui gas prices remained stable as TPS surged towards 6,000 during wave of inscription related activity.\n\nAs 2023 drew to a close, users flooded numerous smart contract platforms with inscription-related transactions, inadvertently serving as stress tests for various networks. Amidst congestion and fee spikes on many platforms, Sui stood out by achieving impressive transactions per second (TPS) without slowdowns or a spike in gas fees.\n\nInitially used in Bitcoin, inscriptions offer a method for recording arbitrary data onchain without the use of smart contracts. This method utilizes the witness field within Bitcoin transactions, requiring minimal fees and permanently associating the data with a distinct Bitcoin coin unit. Consequently, individuals began inscribing tokens, including NFTs, onto Bitcoin.\n\nInscriptions and smart contract platforms\n\nAs inscriptions took off on Bitcoin, developers adapted them to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) by storing inscription data within EVM transaction calldata fields. EVM calldata serves as an optional, read-only, and cost-effective data field for EVM transactions, primarily utilized for smart contract inputs and rollup data. By defining specific interaction formats, inscriptions enable the recording and management of arbitrary data onchain. Similar to Bitcoin, inscriptions on smart contract platforms are commonly used to inscribe token and NFT metadata onchain. For this use, inscriptions offer a cost-effective method of storing data immutably and directly onchain.\n\nInscriptions have also found use on smart contract platforms in creating and managing token balances and metadata. On many chains, particularly those using an implementation of the EVM, transactions involving inscriptions experience significantly lower gas fees compared to typical transactions involving smart contract interactions. However, these inscription use cases often rely on offchain indexers, which introduce various tradeoffs. \n\nThe recent wave of inscription activity has been driven by their ability to create and exchange tokens without burdensome smart contract gas fees, which can be substantial on most blockchains. Consequently, inscription usage surged across most smart contract platforms. As these transactions remain relatively inexpensive, users vying for sought-after inscriptions often resort to submitting transactions in very quick succession. However, the overwhelming influx of transactions during the recent inscription frenzy strained the infrastructure of many blockchain networks, leading to failed transactions, spikes in gas fees, and even network downtime. Essentially, the wave of inscription-related activity inadvertently acted as a grassroots stress-test.\n\nSui’s inscription performance\n\nInscriptions are implemented differently on Sui due to its object-centric data model. With objects acting as the basic storage unit of Sui, what is called an inscription on other chains is simply an object with specified data fields. The data written to object fields can be used for things such as managing tokens not recognized by the Move virtual machine, but inscriptions can be used for much more than these commonly observed use cases. Since inscriptions allow for the posting of immutable data to Sui, developers may find inscriptions as an attractive alternative to other data storage platforms, such as IPFS. \n\nWhile the impetus of the inscription activity seen in December was to avoid burdensome gas fees on other chain, it is expected that inscriptions find a valuable place within the Sui developer toolset as a way to post data immutably onchain. With various methods to create inscriptions on Sui, including ways that leverage Sui’s transaction fast path, developers will explore which design makes the most sense for their use case. Presently, most inscriptions on Sui rely on shared objects and must pass through consensus, offering a unique method to gauge Sui’s throughput in production. \n\nNumber of transaction blocks processes peaked at 13.8M on Dec 22, 2023.\n\nDuring a surge in inscription-driven activity, Sui encountered two days of exceptionally high transactions, surpassing 10 million transaction blocks processed each day, with a peak of over 13.8 million transaction blocks processed on December 22, 2023. In fact, despite the heightened demand, the average gas price decreased, showcasing the network's stability and the efficiency of Sui’s gas pricing mechanism. Demonstrating remarkable resilience, Sui achieved a peak TPS of nearly 6,000, underscoring its impressive network throughput capabilities.\n\nBuilt for the future\n\nBuilt as a cutting edge compute environment, Sui's inherent flexibility and support of developer expression lets it support any need or desire. The expectation of onchain storage and a tokenomics model designed around consistently low gas fees lets Sui easily adapt to new ideas in the world of blockchain. As more developers discover the power of Sui and Move, the possibilities are endless.\n\nREAD NEXT\nFirst Digital Stablecoin Debuting on Sui\nFDUSD, a stablecoin previously only offered on Ethereum and BNB Chain, expands its horizons on Sui.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 11, 2024\nDeepBook Previews Token Launch with NFT Airdrop\nDeepBook NFT recipients will be able to claim the DEEP token when it launches.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 2, 2024\nSolend Team Launches New DeFi Protocol Suilend\nThe team behind the most popular lending protocol on Solana brings its expertise to Sui.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 11, 2024\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

      "html": "Sui.io\nHome\nAbout\nContribute an Article\nMOVE\nTransfer to Object Available on Sui Mainnet\nMysten Labs\nJan 19, 2024\n2 min\n\nThe addition of Transfer to Object creates myriad new possibilities for object coding on Sui.\n\nOne of the core Move features we have been hard at work on is the ability to receive on an object. Move's new feature, Transfer to Object, makes receiving an object by another object, rather than an account address, possible on Sui. \n\nPrior to Transfer to Object, only an address can be on the receiving end of a transfer. Transfer to Object makes it possible to access objects that are owned by another object, essentially by enabling the transferring of child objects out to another object under a set of pre-defined fine-grained policies (“custom receivership rules”) for the receiving operation. \n\nThe new primitives described above make Sui’s object ownership model richer, while unlocking a new set of potential uses and enhancements.\n\nKiosk\nWith Transfer to Object, many-to-one concurrent interactions with an object are now possible. As one example, an app could send dozens of ticket receipts in parallel to a ticket register object. \nMass and concurrent airdrops to Kiosks, or transfer NFTs or other assets from one Kiosk to another can now be built.\nSmart contract wallet  \nWithout Transfer to Object, wallets typically conduct transfers between accounts/addresses based on private keys. With Transfer to Object, one or more onchain “account” objects can become the hub of wallet interactions, essentially an onchain smart contract wallet. Access to to-be-transferred objects can now be associated with rich and dynamic policy checks that are as arbitrary as “is today Thursday” or “does the weather Oracle say the temperature is above 20 degrees Celsius”. If these checks fail the object transfer cannot proceed. \nWith such fine-grained policies for object transfers, one can easily imagine constructing an onchain, upgradable, highly-secure smart contract wallet with multi-sig support and with preset spending limits for different actors to prevent wallet-draining exploits. This is essentially equivalent in functionality to Ethereum Account Abstraction described in ERC-4337. \nIf an address and its private key has been compromised, one can continue to access the underlying account object itself with no change.  \nRWA tokenization \nThe tokenization of real world assets (RWA) gained substantial momentum in 2023, in particular among institutions for capital market instruments. \nEnterprises and institutions are often subject to compliance and separation-of-concern requirements. The ability to implement fine-grained and flexible transfer policies and receivership policies will be essential for institutional adoption of RWA tokenization.    \n\nThere are many available developer resources for Transfer to Object, including:\n\nDocumentation\nExample code using a cash register\nYouTube developer workshop video \n\nIn addition to being available in Devnet, Testnet, and Mainnet, Transfer to Object is also supported in the Rust SDK, Typescript SDK, and the PySui SDK. We hope you find the potential of Transfer to Object as endless as we do.

The quests gamify the learning experience by offering the opportunity to win rewards, motivating developers to build high quality code and showcase their skills to the Sui community.\n\nLaunched last year, the Overmind platform is expanding to the rapidly growing Sui ecosystem. Its new quest series will give developers the hands-on experience they need to build apps with real utility on Sui. Tony Cotzias, Overmind’s Growth Lead said, \"We are excited to collaborate with Sui on onboarding the next wave of developers to Web3. The Sui ecosystem's focus on developer experience coupled with the unparalleled composability of Move on Sui will enable us to take our platform and community to the next level.\"\n\nMove on Sui quests\n\nThe quest journey takes the developer through a series of projects where they will fill in the blanks for both the frontend and smart contract, developing a robust understanding of how things work. The learning experience is designed as a gateway to Sui's developer opportunities, catering to both entrepreneurial developers with their own ideas and those looking to join one of the many growing projects in the ecosystem. Developers acquire not just knowledge but invaluable practical experience, positioning themselves for success in Sui’s growing ecosystem.\n\nThe first quests focus on building a marketplace to serve as a foundation for later quests as well as an NFT lottery called “JPEG Jackpot”. The JPEG Jackpot enables the creation of user-generated lotteries with NFTs as prizes, where participants buy tickets and a random draw determines the winner. It also allows for lottery cancellation and ticket refunds. Some applications include promotional events, community engagement, or a novel way to trade or win rare NFTs. \n\nWhat's next\n\nStay tuned for upcoming quests in the following weeks as Overmind and the Sui Foundation challenge users to take their Move skills to the next level!

      "html": "Sui.io\nHome\nAbout\nContribute an Article\nINFRASTRUCTURE\nAll About Onchain Storage\nSui Foundation\nJan 16, 2024\n2 min\n\nStoring data on Sui powers unique product abilities while remaining economically feasible.\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of blockchain technology, onchain storage solutions play a crucial role in ensuring a secure and censorship-resistant ecosystem. Onchain storage refers to the practice of storing data directly on a blockchain rather than relying on external storage solutions.\n\nWhile there are benefits to networks built solely for the purpose of data storage, opting to store data directly on a blockchain enhances composability, providing greater utility. Storing data on general-purpose blockchains can often incur high costs, but Sui was designed at the outset to make onchain storage economically feasible.\n\nData storage on Sui\n\nSui's distinctive economic model introduces a powerful storage fund, providing the option to store data onchain indefinitely. The storage fund compensates validators for ensuring the continuous availability of data posted to the blockchain. From a user's perspective, the storage fund is straightforward as it seamlessly accumulates storage fees along with each transaction's gas fee. A noteworthy feature of Sui's storage fund is the user's ability to deactivate an object, removing it from the active blockchain state, thereby releasing the remaining SUI locked in the storage fund associated with that object.\n\nIn contrast to the convoluted methods often required for storing data on general-purpose blockchains, Sui simplifies the process. It eliminates the need for workarounds that partition data from the underlying network's data model, resulting in increased utility for onchain data. In Sui, arbitrary data storage is treated the same as data used for smart contracts and other typical purposes. Validators store any file, including image data, that a project indicates should be stored onchain, on their servers. This seamless integration is facilitated by Sui's unique data model and economic design, allowing for cost-effective data posting and the option for updates as desired.\n\nFiles stored onchain in this manner become available indefinitely, as opposed to a model where a smart contract may point to a file stored on an external server. Builders can create complex object associations that also store important information on Sui without fear that part of their project might disappear and users can rest assured knowing that data is stored immutably onchain.\n\nOnchain storage demands\n\nThe fees associated with maintaining data storage are a critical aspect of any viable storage solution. Sui's economic model excels in keeping fees at a minimum, with the average transaction costing less than $0.01. Equally important, if not more so, is Sui's capacity to manage spikes in throughput demand without causing abrupt spikes in gas fees. \n\nThe recent surge in inscription-related activity demonstrated Sui's ability not only to handle high levels of throughput but also to maintain stability in gas fees during such periods. This resilience is particularly crucial for the viability of arbitrary data storage on Sui, emphasizing its capability to handle sustained throughput demands.\n\nSumming it up\n\nThe objective of onchain storage is to diminish dependence on centralized entities for data storage and management while ensuring it remains within the protocol where it is required. Sui, with its distinctive features, emerges as a compelling alternative to centralized and other decentralized storage solutions. This empowers developers to advance decentralization, integrity, and accessibility of data, all while keeping it within the protocol. Sui stands as a viable solution for those seeking to foster a decentralized and robust approach to data storage and management.\n\nREAD NEXT\nThe Top 3 Mobile Wallets on Sui\nMobile wallets are crucial to increasing adoption and accessibility.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAY 15, 2024\nMysticeti Set to Supercharge Consensus on Sui\nA new design for blockchain consensus reduces latency below Sui's already record-breaking speeds.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 10, 2024\nTencent Blockchain RPC Service Now Supports Sui\nSui developers will find a variety of plans supporting apps of all sizes.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 28, 2024\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

      "html": "Sui.io\nHome\nAbout\nContribute an Article\nMOVE\nMove Adds Enums and Macros in 2024 Edition\nSui Foundation\nJan 17, 2024\n5 min\n\nNew features set to launch on Move, Sui's native programming language, in early 2024 include Enums, macro functions, and Method syntax.\n\nUpdates coming to the Move programming language this year give developers new ways to define data and call functions. These significant new features make building apps on Sui even more flexible and comport with the expectations for the most current programming languages.\n\nMove, Sui's native programming language, lets developers write efficient and expressive code. Originally designed by Mysten Labs CTO and co-founder Sam Blackshear, this smart contract-focused language takes advantage of Sui's scalable, high throughput environment.\n\nUpdates in Move 2024 Edition introduce Enums, macro functions, Method syntax, and a host of other new features making it even more capable. As open source, Move and Sui allow continual improvements from the community. \n\nMajor Move updates \n\nThe following features will be available to test in alpha versions initially, followed by release candidate and final releases.\n\nMethod syntax\n\nMethod syntax is a syntactic transformation that allows for functions to be called “on” a value rather than directly from a module. The change greatly improves the ease of programming in Move.\n\nFor example:\n\nlet c2: Coin<SUI> = c.withdraw(10);\n\nExpands to:\n\nlet c2: Coin = sui::coin::withdraw(&mut c, 10);\n\nA new syntax, use fun, will be introduced for adding either public or internal method aliases. This feature can be used for creating an alias to rename a method. Or it can be used to create a local method alias outside of the associated types defining module.\n\nIndex syntax\n\nBuilding on Method syntax, Index syntax adds code to access indexes, with specific code depending on the type of access. Tentatively, this code will look like the following:\n\n&x[i] expands to x.borrow(i)\n&mut x[i] expands to x.borrow_mut(i)\nx[i] expands to *x.borrow(i)\nx[i] = v expands to x.assign(i, v)\nMacro functions\n\nHigher-order functions, such as map, filter, fold, and for_each, are useful in many languages for concisely transforming collections. Move does not have lambdas, closures, or function pointers, which makes defining these sorts of operations impossible.\n\nMacro functions let Move mimic these types of operations without supporting the behavior at runtime. The body of the macro mimicking the higher-order function will get inlined at each call site. And the call site can provide a lambda that will be substituted in as the macro is expanded. \n\nFor example:\n\nlet v2 = v.map!(|x| x + 1);\n\nor\n\nv.for_each!(|x| foo(x));\n\nAdditionally, the \"lambdas\" will support control flow through break and return.\n\nEnums\n\nEnumerations let developers define a single type that may hold multiple different shapes of data. Unlike structs, which always have the same fields, enums can have different fields depending on the variant of the enum. For example, in enum Option<T> { None, Some(T) }, the variant None has no fields and the variant Some has a single field of type T.\n\nMove will allow destructuring enums using match expressions. Some examples of enums in Move are the following:\n\npublic enum Color {\n    RGB { red: u8, green: u8, blue: u8 },\n    HSL { hue: u16, saturation: u8, lightness: u8 },\n    Hex(u32)\n}\npublic enum Option<T> {\n    None,\n    Some(T),\n}\npublic fun is_rgb_color(color: Color): bool {\n    match (color) {\n        Color::RGB{ .. } => true,\n        _ => false,\n    }\n}\nconst EOptionIsNone: u64 = 0;\npublic fun unwrap_some<T>(option: Option<T>): T {\n    match (option) {\n        Option::Some(x) => x,\n        Option::None => abort EOptionIsNone,\n    }\n}\n\nAlthough enums are a part of the Move 2024 Edition, they will not be immediately available on Sui Mainnet. Instead, the feature will first launch only on Devnet, followed by Testnet and then Mainnet, once it seems fit for a production environment. \n\nAdditional new features\n\nBeyond those shown above, the Move 2024 edition includes additional smaller updates, such as eliminating the need for explicit friend declarations and allowing break to take a value. The roadmap contains explicit reasoning and examples behind these updates. In general, they are designed to future-proof Move and make the coding experience more efficient.\n\nBreaking changes\n\nA few planned updates for Move will affect existing code. Of the three changes noted here, most require more explicit code, such as including mut annotations for local variables if they are assigned or mutably borrowed. \n\nStruct declarations\n\nCurrently, struct declarations can only be public, so it's not necessary to include the visibility modifier. To make room for a future where struct types have visibility other than public, the 2024 edition of Move will require public on all struct declarations.\n\nmut annotations\n\nToday, all local variables in Move can be assigned x = e and mutably borrowed &mut x. Variables don't need to be annotated as mut before being modified or mutably borrowed due to the fact that developers can always look locally to check for assignments or mutable borrows. However, the new method syntax, mentioned above, will automatically borrow locals in some circumstances. \n\nTo improve readability and understandability in the presence of method calls, the 2024 edition of Move will require adding mut annotations to all local variables if they are assigned or mutably borrowed.\n\nNew keywords\n\nMove 2024 adds new keywords that were previously accepted as identifiers. The new keywords are:\n\nmut\nenum\ntype\nmatch\n\nTo help with migrating existing fields, functions, or local variables with these names, new syntax lets developers use a keyword as an identifier. For example:\n\nlet `type` = 0; `type` + 1\n\nIn short, any keyword can be used as an identifier by enclosing it in backticks, as with `type`.\n\nTesting and implementation\n\nThe 2024 edition of Move will roll out in a considered manner, letting developers test new features and update existing code accordingly. Developers can begin testing the alpha version by specifying edition = \"2024.alpha\" under the [package] section in their Move.toml files. Features released under the alpha version will be unstable and might fail to compile.\n\nA release candidate version will be released after these new features become relatively stable and the breaking changes have been added. As with the alpha, developers will be able to test the release candidate version by specifying edition = \"2024.rc\" under the [package] section in their Move.toml files. \n\nAlthough the release candidate version will be more stable than the alpha, small breaking changes might occur in the future. Early this year, likely at the beginning of March, the compiler will ask developers if they would like to migrate to the release candidate when they build their projects. An automated tool will then migrate the project to the new edition, adding the edition marker in the Move.toml and automatically fixing all breaking changes.\n\nLater this year, the 2024 Move update will advance from the release candidate and edition = \"2024\" will become the default for all new Move packages.\n\nREAD NEXT\nLet's Move Sui Helps Developers who want to Move on Sui\nThose wanting to learn Move programming now have a fun and intuitive option with the launch of Let's Move Sui!\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 12, 2024\nAll About Smart Contracts\nIn their simplest form, smart contracts govern transactions, but the Sui Move programming language opens the possibility for much more sophisticated apps.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAUG 30, 2023\nAll About Kiosks\nThe Kiosk primitive on Sui lets builders quickly set up shops and sell digital assets, enforcing policies such as royalties that automatically collect fees for content creators.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAUG 23, 2023\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

Today, the company announced an array of new services in support of Move developers to keep pace with Sui's rapid growth.\n\nThe Sui network offers developers capabilities not seen on other blockchains, including horizontal scaling, high throughput, object-focused programming, and cutting edge cryptographic primitives such as zkLogin. The relative newness of the Move programming language, however, means a limited pool of developers ready to take advantage of Sui's opportunity.\n\nThe services with Alibaba Cloud support not only boost existing Move developers, but help onboard new developers to Sui. These services include an artificial intelligence-enabled development environment, community events, and translation of Move documentation into Asian languages.\n\nBuilding a developer base\n\nProjects eager to build on Sui may face difficulties in finding developers experienced in Move. Alibaba Cloud's new services help developers onboard to Move and generally increase developer velocity. Recognizing high interest in Sui from Asian regional builders, the company will help translate Sui documentation into Mandarin Chinese and Korean. These new translations will open Sui development to millions of builders, who can build decentralized apps that offer global and local solutions, ranging from loyalty programs to games to decentralized finance. \n\nAs an exciting new development, Alibaba Cloud, in collaboration with Mysten Labs and the ChainIDE team, will create an artificial intelligence-enhanced tool for Sui builders in ChainIDE, a popular blockchain-focused development environment. This version of ChainIDE will be able to generate code based on natural language prompts from builders, giving them a base to begin fine-tuning for specific applications. Generating code in this manner increases velocity for experienced developers while helping new Move developers learn the language and explore its possibilities.\n\nHelping build the Sui developer community further, Alibaba Cloud plans on sponsoring project incubators and hackathons. With assistance from Mysten Labs, the company will invite projects to incubators in strategic locations, such as Hong Kong, Singapore, and Dubai. These incubators will support promising projects that help grow the Sui ecosystem. Similarly, Alibaba Cloud hackathons, held on a global scale, will incentivize developers to learn and develop new Sui projects. \n\nPutting its stake in the ground further, Alibaba Cloud will support Sui infrastructure by providing Sui Full Node services. The company already offers cloud services supporting independent Sui infrastructure operators, but this full node signals Alibaba Cloud’s commitment to Sui's future. In addition, Mysten Labs' strategic partner Shinami Gas Station will support Sui builders on Alibaba Cloud, making it easy for builders to sponsor user transactions and onboard new users seamlessly. \n\nBeyond Web3\n\nWith a goal of bridging both worlds, Sui technology combines the virtues of Web3 technology with the accessibility and ease-of-use the general public expects from online tools. Projects can make an impact in the real world as well as online. Alibaba Cloud's new offerings will increase Move knowledge and give builders the tools they need to make their projects a reality.\n\nAlibaba Cloud rewards the Sui builder community's enthusiasm for Move and the platform with tools, events, and services that take projects from the planning stages to production. Users benefit by finding more utility and engagement on Sui.\n\nREAD NEXT\nzkLogin Adds Multi-sig Recovery, Apple Credentials\nAn update to zkLogin further extends its capabilities, giving users new options and adding use cases.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAY 9, 2024\nFirst Digital Stablecoin Debuting on Sui\nFDUSD, a stablecoin previously only offered on Ethereum and BNB Chain, expands its horizons on Sui.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 11, 2024\nMysticeti Set to Supercharge Consensus on Sui\nA new design for blockchain consensus reduces latency below Sui's already record-breaking speeds.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 10, 2024\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

Our Staking Aggregator, integrated into the Desig wallet extension, greatly simplifies the process of finding staking opportunities. In fact, its Smart Stake feature allows fully automated staking, while its Discover and Compare feature serves more experienced users who want to exercise more control.\n\nAt DesigLabs, we originally focused on multi-signature wallets for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). This work led us to explore building decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. Sui's launch of liquid staking tokens made it a perfect candidate to create our staking aggregator.\n\nThe Staking Aggregator platform consolidates and optimizes staking rewards from various validators and staking platforms across Sui, maximizing rewards for users. It's able to pool stakes from different platforms to streamline the staking process. Spreading stakes across multiple networks, it reduces the risk of losses associated with a single network failure or volatility.\n\nUser features\n\nIn the interest of serving users who want a very simple experience and those who prefer to monitor data and get into details, our Staking Aggregator offers a number of different tools. \n\nInformed staking decisions\nOne-Click Staking: People new to crypto or those with minimal time can simply stake assets with a single click. The platform will automatically stake in the most efficient way possible. \nSmart Dashboard: For people who want to exercise more control over their experience, the Smart Dashboard shows real-time data and personalized staking recommendations.\nComprehensive Data Presentation: Experts who want a deep dive into the data can view detailed staking options, including validators and liquid staking tokens, with essential metrics like annual percentage yield (APY), total staked, reward pool, and fees.\nDesig's Staking Aggregator offers users a simplified Smart Stake function, staking digital assets quickly and easily.\nUsers choosing the Discover and Compare tool browse through different staking options to make a selection.\nEfficient discovery and comparison tools\nSearch and Sort: Users can set criteria, such as APY or fees, to find specific staking opportunities. \nFilter Function: Users can customize their searches, differentiating between liquid staking tokens and validators, for example.\nOptimal Route Selection: Allowing more specificity than the Filter Function, Optimal Route Selections lets users choose between top validators and liquid staking tokens  based on criteria such as APY, fees, and an overall scorecard.\nScorecard System: We also offer users a comprehensive scorecard system, with a thorough evaluation of staking options.\nStaking Aggregator components\n\nThe Staking Aggregator builds on our previous work in multi-sig wallets, with a cryptographic multi-party computation (MPC) component helping manage each user's interaction with the staking pool. Organization and analysis of staking opportunities occurs on a backend server. \n\nUser flow\n\nThe Staking Aggregator gives users three routes to interact with the system. Smart Stake relies on our staking opportunities analysis to commit digital assets in the most efficient way possible. The Discover and Compare route shows users more information, and lets them actively look for staking opportunities. Users interact with the Stake Management route to view their staked assets and control them.\n\nThe system's user flow includes three primary routes to interact with the Staking Aggregator, referred to as SAG in this diagram.\nInfrastructure\n\nUser requests pass through two different flows in the Staking Aggregator infrastructure. When someone uses the Smart Stake feature, the backend Desig server automatically generates the stake destination, then feeds the proposal into the MPC system, which processes it as a multi-sig transaction. That signed transaction then passes through the Desig server for validation before being submitted to the Sui network to commit the stake.\n\nA Smart Stake request on the Staking Aggregator frontend routes through Desig's MPC system and backend server before committing as a stake on Sui.\n\nUnstaking follows a similar path through the Staking Aggregator as staking. The user submits their request, and the backend Desig server generates the transaction. Again, the MPC system processes the multi-sig transaction. After validation by the backend server, the transaction is confirmed on the Sui network and the staked tokens go to the user's wallet.\n\nUnstaking follows a similar path through the Staking Aggregator as staking, with the various components signing the transaction then returning tokens to the user's wallet.\nProtocol integration\n\nThe Staking Aggregator selects the best pool based on its APY and score. For a staking protocol to appear in the Staking Aggregator's pool (SAGPool), it needs to declare a compatible interface. The Staking Aggregator calculates the score based on metadata, including information such as total staked, APY, epoch data, and rewards.\n\nThe SAGPool selects staking protocols based on their APY and score, a number calculated based on metadata such as total staked, APY, epoch data, and rewards.\n\nThe code for generating a stake pulls the APY and metadata to select a protocol from SAGPool.\n\nexport interface SAGPool {\n  contract: string\n  generateTxStake: ()=>Uint8Array\n  generateTxUnStake: ()=>Uint8Array\n  getAPY:  () => Promise<number>\n  getMetadata : ()=>Promise<SAGMetadata>\n}\nBest of all worlds\n\nOur Staking Aggregator accomplishes two important things. First, it takes data from as many staking protocols as possible to find the best option. Through the scoring system, it automates this process. And second, it lets less experienced users, or people with limited time, to quickly stake with an assurance that the system will find the best option for them.\n\nWe don't want to leave out the experts, of course. Here, the Staking Aggregator provides a dashboard letting them view all the options and make a choice based on their own experience and intuition.\n\nREAD NEXT\nThe Top 3 Mobile Wallets on Sui\nMobile wallets are crucial to increasing adoption and accessibility.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAY 15, 2024\n5 Games Coming to Sui: A Glimpse into the Future of Gaming\nNew gaming experiences are created on Sui and numerous games are launching this year!\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 22, 2024\nSui funds University Researchers from KAIST, UCL, National University of Singapore\nSui Academic Research Awards provides funding to 17 researchers pushing the boundaries of blockchain-related technologies.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 14, 2024\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

      "html": "Sui.io\nHome\nAbout\nContribute an Article\nINFRASTRUCTURE\nAll About Parallelization\nSui Foundation\nJan 23, 2024\n4 min\n\nExecuting transactions in parallel increases scalability and creates better user experiences.\n\nBlockchains revolutionized decentralized applications, allowing efficient execution of transactions across a network. However, interaction with applications on traditional blockchain platforms often face a limitation to scale – sequential transaction execution. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), processes transactions one at a time, hindering efficiency and scalability. \n\nSequential execution models imply that even independent transactions, such as payments between entirely different users, cannot occur simultaneously. Networks using these models suffer from diminished throughput during periods of high demand. Sui overcomes these limitations by enabling concurrent processing of multiple transactions, known as parallel execution.\n\nParallel processing is indispensable to meet the needs of enterprise level infrastructure, common from leading technology companies such as Apple, Netflix, and Facebook. Earlier blockchain architecture did not handle the demands of mass throughput. For a blockchain to meet enterprise demands and be globally useful, parallelization is required.\n\nParallelization improves scalability, reduces latency\n\nTransaction parallelization enables the processing of multiple transactions simultaneously by utilizing multiple computing resources concurrently. This results in better scalability, allowing for increased throughput as hardware resources are scaled up during periods of high demand. \n\nIn Sui, validator nodes can dynamically allocate more computational power to handle additional transaction loads, enhancing the scalability of the network and so improving the overall user experience. Through increased transaction processing efficiency and reduced congestion, a network employing parallelization may necessitate less gas for transaction processing, resulting in lower transaction fees.\n\nProviding multiple transaction processing channels ensures swift confirmation of transactions, even during increased network loads. Picture a one-lane road expanded to a multi-lane highway – more traffic can move through, reducing wait times and fuel costs from idling in traffic. Similarly parallelization in a blockchain eliminates the need for transactions to wait extended times for confirmation or pay excessive fees for prioritization of standard use transactions. Shorter confirmation times contribute to quicker transaction finality and pave the way for latency-sensitive applications, such as games or auctions.\n\nApproaches to parallel execution\n\nThe two most prevalent methods for parallelizing transactions on a monolithic blockchain are a state access method or executing optimistically. The state access method proactively identifies transactions' access to specific parts of the blockchain's state, making it easy to declare independence and execute specific transactions in parallel. In contrast, the optimistic model assumes all transactions are independent initially, only to retrospectively verify this assumption and re-execute transactions that are not parallelizable.\n\nBoth methods are currently utilized in blockchains. Networks like Monad and Aptos implement optimistic parallelization, whereas Sui and Solana utilize state access methods. Optimistic methods are advantageous for their simplicity, requiring less effort from developers in defining transactions. However, executing optimistically introduces the potential for transaction conflicts and other inefficiencies during retrospective verification. State access methods, though requiring a bit more effort from developers, offer more predictable outcomes and avoid latency impacts from retroactive verification.\n\nState access methods also enable more dynamic gas fee markets. Because dependencies are declared upfront, transactions involved in a highly congested part of the blockchain state can be treated differently than others. For instance, a highly popular NFT mint may generate massive amounts of transaction requests in a short timeframe. A network employing a state access method can identify blockchain state hotspots, such as the NFT minting contract, and rate-limit, and even charge more for transactions involving hotspots.\n\nThis allows standard transactions to proceed smoothly, while transactions related to the minting process are prioritized separately based on the the total gas associated with the transactions. On Sui, transactions are included into a checkpoint on a first-come-first-serve basis, but within the checkpoint are ordered based on gas provided. This creates a dynamic that allows for those interested in paying to have priority within a checkpoint without unfairy excluding transactions from a checkpoint that are not offering additional gas so long as they meet the minimum requirements. Achieving this level of granularity is not as easily feasible with optimistic parallel execution.\n\nParallelization in Sui\n\nSui uses a state access method for transaction parallelization and its object-centric data model ensures clarity in state access. Each object exists independently, and every object involved in a transaction must be declared in that transaction. As long as a transaction doesn't interact with an object used in another transaction simultaneously, they are parallelizable. Additionally, transactions not involving a shared object bypass consensus entirely.\n\nTo illustrate, consider Alice owning an NFT, represented as an object in Sui with Alice as the object's owner. When Alice transfers this NFT to Bob, the transaction, categorized as an owned object transaction, bypasses the consensus process. However, if Alice mints an NFT through a smart contract involving a shared object, such as a minting contract, it must undergo consensus and sequencing. \n\nAlthough transactions involving that shared object must be ordered and executed in sequence, the series of transactions related to this NFT mint object can run in parallel to transactions involving other objects.

      "html": "Sui.io\nHome\nAbout\nContribute an Article\nINFRASTRUCTURE\nSui Launching Beta Version of GraphQL RPC Service\nSui Foundation\nJan 26, 2024\n2 min\n\nBeta version available for testing, feedback welcome\n\nNote: The new GraphQL service has launched, and the old beta version is not available anymore. Click here for more details on the new Sui GraphQL RPC service.\n\nIn order to address many known pain points with the existing RPC, Sui is preparing to launch a new RPC service based on GraphQL, dubbed Sui RPC 2.0. GraphQL is an open-source data query and manipulation language designed to facilitate building expressive APIs and services that require complex data querying.\n\nUsers currently have access to a READ-ONLY snapshot of the beta version of Sui Mainnet and Testnet networks. This version is not intended for production-ready applications, but rather to serve as a playground for developers to get familiar with the upcoming GraphQL RPC schema and service.\n\nThe current JSON-RPC remains the main RPC service until the end of Q1 2024. \n\nWhy build a new RPC service?\n\nThe RPC service redesign solves many of the challenges faced by developers working with the current RPCs. RPC 2.0 deprecates the unsafe transaction serialization API and provides more efficient query patterns for dynamic fields, among other fixes for usability issues reported by current users.\n\nOn the back-end, the RPC service and its data-store will be decoupled from fullnodes. Fullnodes’ APIs will be limited to transaction execution and data ingestion for indexers, with all read requests served by a new, stateless RPC service, reading from its own data store. Indexers will consume transaction data from fullnodes in bulk, post-process them and write them to the store.\n\nMore technical details on the architecture of the new GraphQL RPC service and why Sui is switching to it are available in this GitHub issue.\n\nGet started\n\nSui provides an interactive playground for using GraphQL on Sui Mainnet and Testnet networks based on the GraphQL IDE . The online IDE offers autocomplete support (use ctrl+space) and documentation of the schema and the available types. If you’d like to inspect the schema that is currently used , hit the /schema endpoint (e.g., https://graphql-beta.mainnet.sui.io/schema)\n\nFor current known issues and limitations, please consult the docs. \n\nExamples\n\nFor query examples, visit the examples folder in the repository.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of a query written in the online IDE and the result.\n\nRelease timeline\n\nWe continue to work on the GraphQL RPC in order to implement all the envisioned features. Here is the current timeline for building and releasing the service.\n\nPhase 1: completed\n\nInitial schema design and a live beta version (no SLA) of the service released and available to the general public.\n\nMainnet\nTestnet\nPhase 2 target date: Jan 2024\n\nRelease the first version of RPC 2.0, initially operated by Mysten Labs.\n\nPhase 3 target date: Q1 2024\n\nEducate Sui node operators on best practices for running new indexing infrastructure involving RPC 2.0.\n\nPhase 4 target date: TBD\n\nDeprecate JSON-RPC APIs once the ecosystem has successfully migrated to the new RPC 2.0 architecture.\n\nShare your feedback\n\nTry out the API and provide feedback about any potential difficulties you have identified in adopting the GraphQL RPC via this forum post. \n\nREAD NEXT\nThe Top 3 Mobile Wallets on Sui\nMobile wallets are crucial to increasing adoption and accessibility.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAY 15, 2024\nMysticeti Set to Supercharge Consensus on Sui\nA new design for blockchain consensus reduces latency below Sui's already record-breaking speeds.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 10, 2024\nTencent Blockchain RPC Service Now Supports Sui\nSui developers will find a variety of plans supporting apps of all sizes.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 28, 2024\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

      "title": "How Sui Primitives Help DeFi Flourish",
      "url": "https://blog.sui.io/sui-primitives-help-defi-flourish/",
      "html": "Sui.io\nHome\nAbout\nContribute an Article\nDEFI\nHow Sui Primitives Help DeFi Flourish\nSui Foundation\nJan 26, 2024\n4 min\n\nSui primitives enable apps developers to create powerful products and user experiences.\n\nSui's innovative app primitives pave the way for impactful user experiences in DeFi applications. Each primitive, from facilitating efficient liquidity sharing to streamlining user interactions, plays a crucial role in shaping Sui DeFi.\n\nExamining the core functionalities of these primitives individually highlights their significant impact on DeFi apps. However, when considered collectively, their unique ability to enhance user engagement and experience within the Sui DeFi landscape becomes even more pronounced.\n\nDeepBook\n\nDeepBook, an integral element of Sui DeFi, is a protocol designed for efficient liquidity sharing across multiple apps. Operating as a central limit order book, DeepBook systematically records bids and asks in chronological order, autonomously identifying matches between the two sides for smooth trading execution. Harnessing Sui's high-performance capabilities, apps can leverage DeepBook to execute trades with low latency and high throughput. As a native protocol within the Sui ecosystem, DeepBook seamlessly grants DeFi applications access to substantial liquidity, effortlessly accommodating market and limit orders through simple integration.\n\nDeepBook efficiently stores unfilled maker orders in pools, removing them upon successful matching with corresponding orders. DeepBook enables the creation of pools for any asset pair in a permissionless manner. As the first native liquidity layer on Sui, it leverages the robust networking layer and distinctive data model of Sui, thereby streamlining the development of DeFi applications within the Sui ecosystem.\n\nzkLogin\n\nzkLogin serves as a solution to the onboarding challenges faced by new users exploring blockchain applications. The absence of a streamlined login process often creates barriers for users new to blockchain apps, leading to substantial onboarding drop-off. In contrast, zkLogin simplifies this process by enabling users to securely create accounts and conduct transactions using their existing Web2 login credentials.\n\nzkLogin provides developers with flexibility, enabling the offering of invisible wallets that abstract user interactions with the blockchain or a simpler pathway for users to access their onchain assets. It seamlessly integrates with existing account types, such as mnemonic and hardware wallets, catering to both novices and experts based on their preferences. This versatility enhances the accessibility and user-friendly nature of DeFi apps within the Sui ecosystem.\n\nAs an integral part of Sui, zkLogin empowers application builders to provide optimal user experiences, catering to individuals who prefer the convenience of utilizing Web2 logins. zkLogin enhances accessibility and usability, fostering a more inclusive environment for users engaging with DeFi apps within the Sui ecosystem.\n\nSponsored transactions\n\nSui addresses the challenges surrounding blockchain gas fees by introducing sponsored transactions. Requiring that new users pay fees in the coin native to the underlying blockchain creates unnecessary user friction. For those not familiar with blockchain apps, they may be immediately turned away by this. \n\nSponsored transactions eliminates onboarding friction associated with gas fees, allowing apps to subsidize specific user transactions and abstract gas fees away from the end-user experience. Sponsored transactions on Sui offer granular control over gas fee subsidization, providing unique incentives for app developers to enhance user engagement and reduce friction for those new to blockchain. Although placing the onus of gas fees on an app rather than the user may seem an unlikely business model, it gives builders a flexibility in determining the revenue model that works best for them.\n\nProgrammable Transaction Blocks\n\nProgrammable Transaction Blocks (PTBs) are a Sui primitive that offer unique possibilities in composability and greatly simplify blockchain interactions for end users. Instead of requiring multiple transactions to be submitted for a simple action, PTBs enable bundling, signing, and submitting a complex series of transactions in one unified process. Each command executes sequentially, allowing results from one to be utilized in subsequent commands, ensuring a cohesive and atomic process where the entire block fails if one command fails. \n\nPTBs markedly enhance the experience for both app developers and end-users, simplifying and consolidating intricate transactions. This capability allows for the creation and execution of unique DeFi strategies involving multiple applications and interactions within a single transaction block. As a potent tool, PTBs contribute to a seamless and user-friendly blockchain experience, providing a streamlined approach for simplifying interactions in Sui’s DeFi ecosystem.\n\nKiosk\n\nSui's Kiosk primitive empowers users to retain full control over their assets even when listed for sale. When selling items like NFTs, users often have to relinquish certain ownership-related abilities. For instance, an NFT owner may want to maintain access to features associated with ownership even while it is listed for sale. Kiosk not only facilitates the transfer of digital asset ownership but also enables creators to define specific policies for the asset type. This includes custom trading functionalities like auctions, providing a versatile solution for users seeking to interact with and trade their assets seamlessly.\n\nIn essence, Kiosk serves as a straightforward yet highly customizable tool for constructing and engaging with commerce applications on the blockchain. Functioning like a real-world kiosk with a single owner and a designated space for various items, Kiosk simplifies the process of trading unique assets. Whether for individuals or large markets, Kioski offers an all-in-one solution, eliminating the need for additional layers or third-party services commonly required on the traditional web and some other blockchains.\n\nMaking DeFi better\n\nExploring Sui's app primitives reveals how DeFi applications on Sui can deliver powerful user experiences. Apps can leverage DeepBook for instant access to deep liquidity and various trading functions. zkLogin and sponsored transactions eliminate significant blockchain adoption barriers, such as wallets and gas fees. PTBs offer robust composability while simplifying user interactions. Lastly, Kiosk provides a unique approach to trading digital assets with powerful auxiliary capabilities.\n\nSui development is driven by the vision of providing the best experience for both end-users and developers. Core Sui developments focus on empowering app builders through Sui primitives, crucial for realizing this vision. Keep an eye out for upcoming improvements and new Sui primitives throughout the year. It’s an exciting time for Sui builders!\n\nREAD NEXT\nFirst Digital Stablecoin Debuting on Sui\nFDUSD, a stablecoin previously only offered on Ethereum and BNB Chain, expands its horizons on Sui.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 11, 2024\nDeepBook Previews Token Launch with NFT Airdrop\nDeepBook NFT recipients will be able to claim the DEEP token when it launches.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 2, 2024\nSolend Team Launches New DeFi Protocol Suilend\nThe team behind the most popular lending protocol on Solana brings its expertise to Sui.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 11, 2024\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

SuiNS identifiers dramatically simplify how users can specify Sui accounts, creating a significantly better experience. \n\nUnique identifiers have always been valuable in navigating digital spaces. For instance, Wi-Fi networks often have complex, hard-to-remember names. Most internet services allow users to change their network’s name, making it easier to distinguish it from others and add a little personalization.\n\nWhether in Wi-Fi network names, domain extensions, or social media usernames, unique identifiers define and represent entities in the digital realm.\n\nBlockchain name services\n\nIn the realm of blockchain technology, users frequently grapple with lengthy and arbitrary strings of numbers and letters when specifying an account. Typing out a blockchain address is highly cumbersome, and when transferring assets, users must meticulously review each character to ensure accuracy. A minor discrepancy could result in irreversible transfer to an entirely different address. Blockchain name services play a vital role in identification and discoverability, mitigating a significant pain point in everyday blockchain transactions.\n\nName services like SuiNS not only alleviate a burden, but also let users own social usernames. Unlike Web2 name services, which often face issues of censorship and lack of individual ownership, SuiNS provides users with greater control. An illustrative example is when Twitter rebranded to X; the handle @X was forcefully taken from its original owner for use by the platform. Blockchain naming services seek to address such challenges by granting users ownership of their social usernames.\n\nWeb2 social usernames remain vulnerable to control by centralized entities, whereas Web3 identifiers are directly owned by individuals. Blockchain name services represent a significant step towards revolutionizing the concept of digital identity.\n\nSui Name Service - SuiNS\n\nAs a name service platform, SuiNS issues identifiers on Sui, like alice.sui. These identifiers can link to a Sui account, directing transactions with alice.sui as the recipient to the associated Sui account. Represented as NFTs, SuiNS identifiers are stored in the user's wallet, ensuring that ownership benefits, granted to Sui objects, also apply to SuiNS identifiers.\n\nThe owner of the NFT for the domain name has the authority to configure parameters for the identifier, determining, for instance, which wallet account the identifier directs to. While one account can possess multiple identifiers, only one identifier can point to a specific account at any given time. Additionally, identifiers have the flexibility to point to accounts other than the owning account.\n\nSuiNS allows further personalization by letting users associate an avatar with their names. The avatar is an NFT which, given Sui's support for composable objects, opens up a world of possibilities for users' graphical representations. Along with avatars, SuiNS also supports IPFS web sites. Users can create simple informational pages or complex, dynamic sites. \n\nGiven that these identifiers are not able to be reclaimed by a centralized entity, SuiNS assigns them expiration dates at the one year mark. Users may renew their identifiers, holding them indefinitely while keeping the namespace adaptable and dynamic. This approach proves beneficial in cases of lost account access. Following the expiration date, the SuiNS identifier is reclaimed and becomes available for purchase again, contributing to a continuous cycle that reintroduces unrenewed identifiers into the ecosystem.\n\nUnclaimed SuiNS identifiers are priced based on the number of characters: those with five characters or more cost 20 SUI, those with four characters cost 100 SUI, and the most limited group with only three characters are priced at 500 SUI.\n\nPersonalizing identity\n\nIn a digital space, human-readable names are crucial for easy identification and discovery of entities. In the context of blockchain technology, name services enhance user experience by simplifying complex blockchain addresses into clear and readable identifiers. SuiNS offers identifiers for Sui that extend beyond mere functionality, providing users with genuine ownership akin to any object on Sui. SuiNS enhances the user experience by offering a path for more user-centric and streamlined interactions on Sui.\n\nREAD NEXT\nThe Top 3 Mobile Wallets on Sui\nMobile wallets are crucial to increasing adoption and accessibility.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAY 15, 2024\n5 Games Coming to Sui: A Glimpse into the Future of Gaming\nNew gaming experiences are created on Sui and numerous games are launching this year!\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 22, 2024\nSui funds University Researchers from KAIST, UCL, National University of Singapore\nSui Academic Research Awards provides funding to 17 researchers pushing the boundaries of blockchain-related technologies.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 14, 2024\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

      "html": "Sui.io\nHome\nAbout\nContribute an Article\nDEFI\nCost Efficiency, Composability, and Decentralization with Sui’s Liquid Staking\nSui Foundation\nFeb 2, 2024\n3 min\n\nSui's liquid staking implementation avoids barriers commonly associated with liquid staking protocols and tokens.\n\nLiquid staking emerged as a foundational element for DeFi on proof-of-stake blockchains, with approximately 45 percent of total staked ETH currently locked in liquid staking protocols. This substantial adoption highlights a clear demand for liquid staking tokens (LSTs) among users.\n\nHowever, on many blockchains, particularly those using the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM), existing liquid staking protocols pose challenges for both users and developers, often raising concerns about stake decentralization. For instance, over 30% of staked ETH on Ethereum is attributed to Lido, the primary liquid staking protocol. \n\nSui's approach to liquid staking sets itself apart, providing native integration with the network through a unified coin standard and composability. These features set the stage for more efficient and cost-effective liquid staking transactions.\n\nSui’s coin standard\n\nLiquid staking on Sui addresses a prevalent issue seen in various proof-of-stake implementations, where users who have already staked SUI encounter the unbonding period when attempting to utilize a liquid staking protocol. Sui introduces a significant improvement in staking design by enabling the exchange of the staked SUI object for an LST. This innovative approach lets users seamlessly transition to liquid staking without the constraints of the unbonding period, a notable advancement facilitated by Sui's use of a single coin standard\n\nUnlike the approach of having multiple token standards depending on the intended use, Sui adopts a unified and comprehensive coin standard. This singular standard simplifies integration for apps, as they only need to support this single coin type, eliminating the necessity to integrate different token standards for compatibility. On Sui, all tokens, regardless of their purpose, are treated equally as coin objects at the network layer. This uniformity is advantageous for liquid staking protocols, ensuring that apps seamlessly recognize both SUI and staked SUI objects. The functionality of natively staked SUI can be extended without requiring changes to the security of the underlying staked asset.\n\nA distinctive feature of Sui's single coin type is the absence of differing computational requirements when interacting with LSTs compared to the native asset, SUI. In contrast, platforms like Ethereum impose higher gas costs for interacting with ERC-20 tokens, such as LSTs, compared to the native asset, ETH. On Sui, this translates to no difference in gas pricing between native SUI and LSTs. This eliminates any gas-related burdens commonly observed on EVM-based chains, providing a seamless and uniform experience for users interacting with different tokens on the Sui network.\n\nSui LST composability\n\nSui's native staking implementation enhances the composability of liquid staking by enabling stake and unstake actions to be entirely onchain and, crucially, atomic. This contrasts with the predominantly offchain solutions in many other ecosystems, which lack the atomic nature necessary for composable extensions of native staking. Sui's approach ensures seamless and secure composability, allowing for more flexible and integrated interactions within the liquid staking ecosystem on the Sui network.\n\nUpon unstaking an LST on Sui, it is possible to receive the corresponding SUI in the same transaction. Leveraging Sui's primitive, Programmable Transaction Blocks (PTBs), the unstaked SUI can be seamlessly utilized as input for another function within the PTB. This high degree of composability is a direct result of both PTBs and Sui's innovative liquid staking design, showcasing the platform's ability to enable versatile and interconnected transactions.\n\nStaking decentralization\n\nLiquid staking serves as a fundamental catalyst for enhanced decentralization by incentivizing users to engage in both staking to the network and providing capital to DeFi protocols. This contrasts with scenarios where users are given the option to solely choose one option, often based on the return, likely leading to a less favorable outcome for the overall amount of native stake delegated to validators. The dual incentivization mechanism in liquid staking promotes a more balanced and decentralized participation, contributing to the robustness and resilience of the network.\n\nMoreover, Sui's native staking mechanism facilitates permissionless delegation, letting users stake as little as one SUI to any validator within the active validator set. This intentional design choice plays a crucial role in promoting long-term decentralization of stake. The LSTs on Sui often follow a similar design, preserving the same decentralized benefit. This commitment to accessibility and decentralization underscores Sui's dedication to creating an inclusive and robust staking ecosystem.\n\nIn line with any DeFi protocol, transparency stands as a paramount consideration in product design. For liquid staking protocols, a key avenue for promoting transparency is providing visibility into the protocol's underlying delegation. This, coupled with the capacity for permissionless delegation to any validator, offers users a valuable level of transparency. It allows users to understand the state of a liquid staking protocol at any given point in time.\n\nSolidifying liquid staking knowledge\n\nSui's innovative approach to liquid staking represents a significant evolution of Sui DeFi. Addressing challenges seen in other ecosystems, Sui introduces a unified and comprehensive coin standard, eliminating many common issues observed by both users and developers.\n\nEmbracing the core philosophy of promoting decentralization in blockchain technology, Sui's liquid staking implementation not only contributes to the decentralization of the network but also encourages active user participation in DeFi activities. In essence, liquid staking on Sui reflects a holistic and forward-thinking approach, poised to enhance and reshape the landscape of decentralized finance.\n\nAdditional contributions for this article came from Kevin (@KevinAftermath), Co-Founder and CTO of Aftermath Finance.\n\nREAD NEXT\nFirst Digital Stablecoin Debuting on Sui\nFDUSD, a stablecoin previously only offered on Ethereum and BNB Chain, expands its horizons on Sui.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 11, 2024\nDeepBook Previews Token Launch with NFT Airdrop\nDeepBook NFT recipients will be able to claim the DEEP token when it launches.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 2, 2024\nSolend Team Launches New DeFi Protocol Suilend\nThe team behind the most popular lending protocol on Solana brings its expertise to Sui.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 11, 2024\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

      "html": "Sui.io\nHome\nAbout\nContribute an Article\nDEFI\nNAVI Leverages Silicon Valley Know-How for DeFi Success\nSui Foundation\nFeb 5, 2024\n4 min\n\nSui's enterprise-scale approach to infrastructure technology led NAVI to build its banking protocol on the network.\n\nWith features such as online banking and chip cards, banks have long embraced technology. However, Charles and Elliscope took a different approach in founding NAVI Protocol. Using their technology expertise and background, they embraced banking. \n\n\"We believe that NAVI can become a Web3 bank for Web2 users, where kindness and open-mindedness are at the heart of the company culture,\" said Elliscope. The founders chose the name NAVI, which means be kind to each other, to reflect their ethos.\n\nWith stints at companies such as Apple and LinkedIn, NAVI's founders have been inculcated in Silicon Valley innovation, working with top engineers from around the world to develop technology used by millions globally. When they evaluated Sui as a potential platform for NAVI, they recognized how it was developed with the same eye towards innovative scalable impact.\n\nSui's founders, coming from a similar background, built the network from the ground to support enterprise-scale applications. Features such as Sui's object-focused programming model go far beyond the account-based model of other blockchains to give experienced developers the expressiveness available in the infrastructure from leading Silicon Valley technology companies.\n\nBuilding for users\n\nAt its core, NAVI enables borrowing and lending on Sui. The protocol lets people contribute tokens, which will increase at a set interest rate. And on the other side of the equation, people can pay the interest rate to borrow tokens. Borrowers typically would use those tokens in ways that increase their supply beyond the interest rate. NAVI maintains a unified lending and collateral pool, maximizing its capital efficiency. \n\n\"We took inspiration for NAVI’s design from traditional financial institution models that operate lending and deposit offerings, which has proven to be historically very effective. By integrating this approach with the flexibility and innovation of blockchain technology, we've been able to create a protocol that is both user-friendly and efficient,\" said M, NAVI's head of business.\n\nBy various metrics, NAVI's growth has been considerable, testament to how well it serves DeFi users borrowing or lending crypto on Sui.\n\nThe results have been impressive, with NAVI continually appearing among the top protocols on DeFiLlama's Sui listing page. It holds $150 million in total value locked and borrowed assets of $60 million.\n\nBeyond the efficiency of its protocol, part of NAVI's success comes from its user interface. The main dashboard shows each user their token supply and borrowed amounts on the protocol, along with a health metric. Through Notifi, users receive updates through their preferred communication channels if the health metric signals they need to adjust their accounts. The dashboard also shows a lists of tokens, including SUI, USDC, and WETH, along with their yields and a simple \"Supply\" button, the latter enabling one-click lending.\n\nOver less than a year, NAVI grew its user base to nearly 800,000.\n\nOther tabs in the interface let users view NAVI's market by token supply, access bridging and swap capabilities, and see the top users on a leaderboard. This gamification feature includes categories for NAVI's point rating, supplied amount, borrowed amount, and overall activity. \n\n\"We partnered with renowned brands in the Web3 industry, like OKX on a variety of campaigns, Bitget Wallet, Zealy, and Galxe,\" said Ivan, NAVI's marketing lead. As an example of these partnerships, the leaderboard includes a category showing users who completed quests on the Zealy platform.\n\nLeveraging object security\n\nDeFi protocols must practice and demonstrate superior security to protect their users and reputations. One thing that drew NAVI's founders to Sui was its object-focused data architecture, making it more resistant to exploits than account-based blockchains.\n\n\"All the assets and tokens are represented as objects,\" said Charles, \"which avoids attack patterns common on EVM chains, like reentrancy attacks or double spending.\"\n\n“This design paradigm allows for more robust control over how objects interact and are accessed, effectively mitigating a broad spectrum of attack vectors. The granularity of control extends to specifying who can interact with an object, under what conditions, and through what methods. Unlike traditional account-based systems that rely on more generalized security measures, Sui's object-centric approach enables developers to tailor security policies directly to the individual characteristics of each digital asset,” said Haoran, NAVI’s core smart contract developer.\n\nNAVI's focus on user experience includes making sure that DeFi activities initiated by customers complete quickly and successfully. Users of Web2-based financial apps expect actions they initiate to conclude almost immediately. It's essential that these users find a similar experience when they open an account on NAVI. \n\nSui supports this experience with a consensus mechanism that processes transactions quicker than other blockchains. When someone engages with NAVI for DeFi, their transactions finalize in less than a second, with settlement occurring within a few seconds. And with Sui's scalability, those times don't increase with volume, letting NAVI support trading surges.\n\nLeaning into the future\n\nDeepBook, Sui's first native liquidity layer, plays a part in NAVI's future plans. The protocol integrates with DeepBook for liquidations, ensuring it can weather changes in the market. The liquidity support offered by DeepBook has NAVI looking into new options for users, including swaps and flash loans.\n\nWith their experience at leading technology companies, coupled with a passion for Web3 and decentralization, NAVI's founders are well equipped to leverage Sui's architecture and features. The protocol's success already shows they are on the right track.\n\nREAD NEXT\nFirst Digital Stablecoin Debuting on Sui\nFDUSD, a stablecoin previously only offered on Ethereum and BNB Chain, expands its horizons on Sui.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 11, 2024\nDeepBook Previews Token Launch with NFT Airdrop\nDeepBook NFT recipients will be able to claim the DEEP token when it launches.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 2, 2024\nSolend Team Launches New DeFi Protocol Suilend\nThe team behind the most popular lending protocol on Solana brings its expertise to Sui.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 11, 2024\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

      "title": "All About Fiat On-Ramps",
      "url": "https://blog.sui.io/fiat-on-ramps-explained/",
      "html": "Sui.io\nHome\nAbout\nContribute an Article\nSUI ECOSYSTEM\nAll About Fiat On-Ramps\nSui Foundation\nFeb 8, 2024\n3 min\n\nFiat on-ramps are essential gateways facilitating conversion from traditional currencies to digital assets.\n\nThe bridge between traditional fiat currencies, such as the US dollar or Japanese Yen, and digital assets is crucial for mass adoption of Web3 technologies. Fiat on-ramps serve as the entry points for individuals looking to enter the Web3 world, enabling them to convert their traditional money into various digital assets. Understanding how these on-ramps work and their significance empower newcomers and seasoned enthusiasts alike in navigating Web3 apps.\n\nWhat are fiat on-ramps?\n\nFiat on-ramps are platforms, services, or mechanisms that facilitate the conversion of fiat currency into digital assets like BTC, ETH, or SUI. These on-ramps provide users with the means to purchase digital assets using their traditional money, essentially acting as bridges between the traditional financial system and the Web3 ecosystem.\n\nWhile millions of people worldwide have already purchased digital assets, the process still can be challenging. An intuitive and straightforward on-ramp process is essential for Web3 adoption to continue. From a user perspective, ideally there would be a seamless experience in which it's just as easy to use an on-ramp as it is to use any other traditional payment platform.\n\nOff-ramps, complementary to on-ramps, operate similarly but in reverse, enabling users to convert digital assets into fiat currencies. An apt comparison is a retail store optimizing both checkout and return processes to attract and retain customers effectively. A store that excels in providing both on-ramps (short checkout lines) and off-ramps (hassle-free return policies), offers a better user experience, contributing to the store’s ability to grow and thrive.\n\nTypes of fiat on-ramps\nCryptocurrency exchanges: Likely the most common form of fiat on-ramps, exchanges allow users to deposit fiat currency into their accounts and use it to buy digital assets at market prices. Exchanges vary in terms of supported fiat currencies, payment methods, and regulatory compliance but typically offer more optionality in available digital assets when compared to other on-ramp types.\nPeer-to-peer (P2P) platforms: Users can buy digital assets with fiat currency by interacting with other users who are selling their digital assets. P2P platforms connect buyers and sellers directly, eliminating the need for intermediaries.\nBrokerage services: Brokerage services offer a user-friendly interface for gaining exposure to digital assets either by directly purchasing the assets or through some sort of fund. These platforms often cater to beginners by simplifying the purchasing process, providing additional resources and support, and offering a limited variety of digital assets.\nPayment processors: Certain payment processors enable merchants to accept payments using digital assets, allowing users to use digital assets to buy goods and services by facilitating conversion into fiat currency at the point of sale. These services are particularly useful for merchants seeking to integrate digital assets into their payment options or wallets that want to offer purchases directly in the app.\n\nWhen selecting a fiat on-ramp, several factors can be considered, including security, compliance, fees, supported assets, and payment methods. For instance, some users may prioritize simplicity and opt for an on-ramp directly supported by their wallet, while others may prioritize access to a broad range of digital assets and choose a different on-ramp. Additionally, some users may have restricted options due to country compliance and regulation. There is no one-size-fits-all solution and individual users will likely have different on-ramp needs throughout their Web3 journey.\n\nThe importance of fiat on-ramps\n\nFiat on-ramps play a pivotal role in fostering mainstream adoption of Web3 apps by providing individuals a pathway to obtain digital assets. On-ramps are another tool apps can use to create a seamless user experience by reducing friction in the onboarding and offboarding processes. Users are more likely to engage with an app that offers a smooth and convenient transition between fiat and digital assets.\n\nMoreover, fiat on-ramps serve as catalysts for liquidity and market growth within the Web3 ecosystem. By facilitating the inflow of fiat currency, these platforms contribute to increased trading volumes, price discovery, and overall market activity, enhancing the liquidity and stability of digital asset markets.\n\nConnecting currencies\n\nFiat on-ramps serve as indispensable gateways for individuals seeking to explore the world of digital assets. Whether through exchanges, P2P platforms, brokerage services, or payment processors, these on-ramps provide users with the means to transition from traditional fiat currencies to digital assets seamlessly. As the Web3 ecosystem continues to evolve, fiat on-ramps will remain important in driving widespread adoption and integration of digital assets into the global financial landscape.\n\nREAD NEXT\nThe Top 3 Mobile Wallets on Sui\nMobile wallets are crucial to increasing adoption and accessibility.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAY 15, 2024\nMysticeti Set to Supercharge Consensus on Sui\nA new design for blockchain consensus reduces latency below Sui's already record-breaking speeds.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 10, 2024\nTencent Blockchain RPC Service Now Supports Sui\nSui developers will find a variety of plans supporting apps of all sizes.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 28, 2024\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

      "html": "Sui.io\nHome\nAbout\nContribute an Article\nSUI ECOSYSTEM\nHow to get a SuiNS Name\nSui Foundation\nFeb 13, 2024\n4 min\n\nWalk through the steps to purchase and register SuiNS names.\n\nSimilar to the Domain Name Service on the Internet, SuiNS translates a complex identifier into a human-readable form. However, a SuiNS name is something more than a website address. It serves as an identity, akin to an email address. People with a SuiNS name can use it as their online address on Sui, personalizing it with an NFT-based avatar and, yes, even a website in the form of IPFS pages. \n\nPrerequisites to purchasing\n\nBefore you get started on the journey towards obtaining a SuiNS name, there are a few simple prerequisites. The first is that you have a Sui wallet installed and a Sui account set up.\n\nThe second is to fund your wallet with SUI tokens either from a centralized exchange, such as Binance, Coinbase, or Gemini, or any on-ramp that fits your needs. \n\nFinally, ensure that you are aware of best practices when interacting with any blockchain-related services such as exchanges, wallets, and apps. \n\nObtaining a SuiNS name\n\nBecause SuiNS names are represented as NFT objects, they can be transferred like any other NFT on Sui and can be traded on marketplaces. Here we are only focusing on purchasing SuiNS names from the SuiNS website itself.\n\nStep 1: Search for a SuiNS name to purchase\n\nWhen searching for SuiNS names, you can check the availability via the status displayed beneath the name. If an item is available, it will show a listed price and an option to begin registration; if it's taken, you'll only have the option to view information about the SuiNS. Upon finding an available SuiNS name you wish to purchase, simply click the start button to proceed.\n\nThe SuiNS search function lets you find an available name to register.\nStep 2: Register SuiNS name\n\nWhen acquiring a SuiNS directly from the SuiNS website, users have the option to choose the registration duration, ranging from one to five years, with the total price adjusting accordingly. Following this, users can designate the SuiNS as their default, enabling reverse lookup of the associated account through this chosen name.\n\nThe SuiNS registration form lets you select a duration up to five years, making it easy to retain control of your name.\nStep 3: Complete purchase\n\nUpon choosing to register a name, users are directed to sign and submit a transaction to finalize the purchase, registration, and optionally, set the SuiNS as default. Once this process is completed, the SuiNS becomes owned, registered, and ready for use. Users can further inspect the SuiNS objects through explorers like Suiscan or SuiVision.\n\nAfter the transaction is approved, the request to purchase and register the SuiNS name will be processed by the network.\nPricing, renews, and defaults\n\nSuiNS names are priced based on the character count and are categorized into three groups: names with five or more characters, names with four characters, and the most exclusive group with only three characters. The pricing structure increases as the character count decreases, reflecting the limited supply of names with fewer characters.The total purchase price is calculated by multiplying the SuiNS name price per year by the registration duration, plus applicable gas fees.\n\nWhen acquiring a SuiNS name, users choose a registration period. At the end of this period, users must decide whether to renew to retain the name or allow it to unregister, returning it to the SuiNS website marketplace for anyone to purchase. It may be worth setting a personal reminder towards the end of a SuiNS registration period.\n\nUsers have the freedom to own and register numerous SuiNS names, but only one can serve as the account's default. When sending tokens or using any registered SuiNS name, they will be deposited into the registering account, yet apps will primarily recognize the default SuiNS name associated with the account. For instance, if a user possesses multiple SuiNS names and sets \"abcdef.sui\" as default, apps like wallets will utilize this name to identify the account.\n\nAlthough you can have multiple SuiNS names attached to a wallet address, the default name is what will appear in apps.\nWith name in hand\n\nSuiNS names not only revolutionize user interactions within the Sui ecosystem by providing human-readable identifiers for Sui accounts, but also enable users to establish a distinct identity on Sui. By simplifying the process of obtaining and managing these names, SuiNS offers a streamlined experience suitable for users of all levels, making it accessible even to newcomers to blockchain interactions. As the SuiNS protocol evolves, future improvements promise greater functionality, unlocking unique use cases and features within Sui apps.\n\nREAD NEXT\nThe Top 3 Mobile Wallets on Sui\nMobile wallets are crucial to increasing adoption and accessibility.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAY 15, 2024\n5 Games Coming to Sui: A Glimpse into the Future of Gaming\nNew gaming experiences are created on Sui and numerous games are launching this year!\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 22, 2024\nSui funds University Researchers from KAIST, UCL, National University of Singapore\nSui Academic Research Awards provides funding to 17 researchers pushing the boundaries of blockchain-related technologies.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 14, 2024\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

For example, an issuer who created one million stablecoins tied to the US dollar might maintain one million actual US dollars in a secure bank reserve.\n\nReasons for stablecoins\n\nStablecoins offer stability in the volatile cryptocurrency landscape, appealing to users who desire a dependable store of value while still retaining key digital asset characteristics:\n\nGlobal accessibility: Like other other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins can be accessed globally by anyone with an internet connection, enabling seamless transactions across borders and around the clock.\nEfficient transactions: Transferring stablecoins is fast, cost-effective, and secure, thanks to their blockchain-based infrastructure. \nDigital nativity and programmability: Stablecoins are inherently digital, allowing for programmable functionalities with smart contracts. This programmability makes stablecoins versatile tools for developing innovative financial products and services tailored to specific needs.\nMechanisms of stability\n\nStablecoins employ various mechanisms to maintain their stability. The most prevalent mechanisms include:\n\nFiat-collateralized stablecoins: These stablecoins are backed by reserves of fiat currency often held in banks. For every stablecoin issued, there is an equivalent amount of fiat currency held in reserve. Examples include USDC, which claims to be backed one-to-one by US dollars.\nCrypto-collateralized stablecoins: Instead of fiat reserves, these stablecoins are backed by a reserve of other cryptocurrencies. Smart contracts govern these systems, ensuring that the value of the collateral consistently exceeds the value of the stablecoins issued. DAI, pegged to the US dollar and collateralized by Ethereum, is a prominent example.\nAlgorithmic stablecoins: These stablecoins leverage algorithms and smart contracts to adjust the supply dynamically, maintaining a stable value. The most notable example of an algorithmic-stabilized stablecoin is FRAX, which at the time of writing is transitioning away from algorithm reliance.\n\nNot all stablecoins fall into one bucket, as stablecoins can be backed by anything, including precious metals like gold. Certain stablecoins adopt hybrid approaches, utilizing multiple types of reserves. For instance, Ondo Finance offers stablecoin-like tokens that are backed by short-term US treasuries, money market funds, and bank deposits. Stablecoin alternatives, like Ondo Finance’s products, can offer exposure to yield-generating assets while remaining liquid and usable. The Sui ecosystem will soon see such products available for use.\n\nUse cases of stablecoins\n\nStablecoins serve a variety of purposes across different sectors:\n\nTrading digital assets: Stablecoins are an essential element to the onchain trading environment. Traders often use stablecoins in trading pairs and also treat them as a hedge against the volatility of other cryptocurrencies.\nDecentralized finance (DeFi): Stablecoins play a fundamental role in the burgeoning DeFi ecosystem. They serve as a stable medium of exchange and store of value within decentralized lending platforms, liquidity pools, and decentralized exchanges.\nMerchant payments: Some merchants accept stablecoins as a form of payment, offering an alternative to traditional payment methods while avoiding the volatility risks associated with cryptocurrencies.\nRemittances and cross-border payments: With stablecoins, individuals and businesses can conduct cross-border transactions swiftly and inexpensively, bypassing the delays and fees associated with traditional banking systems.\nRisks in stablecoins\n\nWhen considering the risks associated with stablecoin usage, there are two obvious aspects that must be considered. First, when reserves are held with a bank or another third party without transparency, the concern of counterparty risk arises. This risk involves questioning whether the entity truly holds the collateral it claims. This matter has been widely debated concerning the credibility of certain stablecoin issuers' claims of maintaining a one-to-one backing.\n\nSecondly, cryptocurrencies were designed to eliminate the need for intermediary companies that traditionally handle users' funds. Intermediaries inherently have control over these funds. For instance, they can usually halt or reverse transactions upon user request. While this aspect is often seen as advantageous for blockchain technology, users unfamiliar with this responsibility may be taken aback when attempting to stop or reverse a transaction.\n\nFrom old to new\n\nStablecoins emerged as a vital component of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, appealing to users seeking a reliable store of value. They bridge the traditional finance world, with its generally trustworthy notions of value, and cryptocurrency, which offers technical security. \n\nStablecoin versatility extends to remittances, trading, DeFi, and beyond, contributing to the growing adoption of blockchain technology. Yet, challenges remain inherent in any new technology. As the landscape continues to evolve, a deeper understanding of stablecoins and their mechanisms is essential for investors, regulators, and stakeholders alike.\n\nNote: This content is for general educational and informational purposes only and should not be construed or relied upon as an endorsement or recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any asset, investment or financial product and does not constitute financial, legal, or tax advice.\n\nREAD NEXT\nFirst Digital Stablecoin Debuting on Sui\nFDUSD, a stablecoin previously only offered on Ethereum and BNB Chain, expands its horizons on Sui.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 11, 2024\nDeepBook Previews Token Launch with NFT Airdrop\nDeepBook NFT recipients will be able to claim the DEEP token when it launches.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 2, 2024\nSolend Team Launches New DeFi Protocol Suilend\nThe team behind the most popular lending protocol on Solana brings its expertise to Sui.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 11, 2024\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

      "html": "Sui.io\nHome\nAbout\nContribute an Article\nINFRASTRUCTURE\nEnabling Zero Auth Downloads for Node Operators at a Tenth of the Cost\nMysten Labs\nFeb 16, 2024\n8 min\n\nAdding Cloudflare's R2 service as a repository for Sui's network snapshots greatly reduced the cost of serving these 800 gigabyte files.\n\nValidators and Full nodes running on the Sui network need to have the highest levels of reliability and uptime in order to deliver a high throughput scalable blockchain. A critical part of running a stateful application reliably is to ensure that hardware failovers can be done with relative ease. If the disk fails or another type of outage affects the machine running your Validator, there should be an easy way to migrate the Validator without having to reprocess all chain history. \n\nEnsuring seamless failovers are where Snapshots come in. State snapshots have two forms in the Sui network, Formal and Database. Formal snapshots contain the minimal state that makes up all of the Validator consensus information at the end of an epoch. Database snapshots are truly a full copy of a node’s database. \n\nSnapshots don’t have a lot of utility unless they are stored where they can be accessed easily and reliably. When starting to upload snapshots at the Sui network genesis, Amazon Web Services' (AWS) S3 was the perfect choice as a reliable backend for storage which could be shared with the early node operators on the Sui network. Mysten Labs started hosting public snapshots on S3 which could be used by any node operator to quickly sync a Full node or Validator and introduce it to the network. \n\nHowever, the simple act of hosting an S3 bucket which allowed for public downloads of state snapshots turned out to be a more painful user experience than we expected. The format of the state snapshot necessitates that you use the AWS command line interface (CLI) for downloading the many files that are contained in a single snapshot. If you don’t have a pre-existing set of AWS credentials to plug in when calling the AWS CLI, you need to use a lightly documented incantation of the AWS CLI: aws s3 cp --no-sign-request. \n\nIn addition to the user issues, Sui’s snapshots were growing at an exponential rate. As an ultra-high throughput blockchain, the amount of data Sui generates is almost unprecedented. Each time a state snapshot was being downloaded it would take hours to pull the over 800 gigabytes of data from S3 onto a node operator's host.\n\nFor any readers familiar with the math behind AWS S3 pricing, the public good which was s3://mysten-mainnet-snapshots became expensive quickly. S3 charges you per gigabyte on data transferred out of S3. Because most operators are running nodes outside of AWS, this applies to the Mysten Lab's snapshot bucket. We were quickly running up five figure monthly charges to host this public resource.\n\nServing state snapshots to Validators and Full Nodes resulted in daily egress from AWS S3 nearing 40 terabytes a day.\n\nCloudflare recently announced R2, an S3 competitor, which is unique in its pricing model: zero egress costs. This is a perfect fit for hosting a dataset which is regularly fetched, and a huge winning feature over S3. \n\nRather than do a full migration, we chose to add R2 as an alternative source to S3, and move S3 to a Requester Pays model. S3 has great performance and features like global transfer acceleration that we did not want to give up. The major part of this migration was not adjusting our tooling to write to R2 (R2 is S3 API-compatible), but modifying the Sui application to easily read from R2. \n\nSupporting permissionless downloads on R2\n\nAsking users to use the AWS CLI against R2 was not an acceptable experience; we instead wanted users to be able to point our tooling at db-snapshot.mainnet.sui.io and read the files hosted there with zero authentication required (having a zero authentication option was important to us as we want to make it as easy as possible for anyone to run a Sui Full node). \n\nAWS S3 request signing is a crucial aspect of interacting securely with Amazon S3 resources. When a request is made to an S3 bucket, whether it's for uploading an object, downloading a file, listing objects, or any other operation, the request needs to be signed to ensure its authenticity and integrity. The process typically involves creating an authenticated http request by signing it with the user's access keys (access key ID, secret access key). \n\nFor publicly accessible files or objects, it is technically possible to bypass signing of requests for reading (but not listing) resources for most cloud providers but is not supported in the Rust object store library we are using. As such, we decided to add this support in our codebase. We wanted to add zero authentication support but give users the option to choose between restoring snapshots from S3 with signed requests (because buckets have requester pays mode enabled) or from R2 without signing. To do this cleanly, we first declared abstractions for common object store operations in our codebase:\n\n#[async_trait]\npub trait ObjectStoreGetExt: std::fmt::Display + Send + Sync + 'static {\n   /// Return the bytes at given path in object store\n   async fn get_bytes(&self, src: &Path) -> Result<Bytes>;\n}\n\n#[async_trait]\npub trait ObjectStoreListExt: Send + Sync + 'static {\n   /// List the objects at the given path in object store\n   async fn list_objects(\n       &self,\n       src: Option<&Path>,\n   ) -> object_store::Result<BoxStream<'_, object_store::Result<ObjectMeta>>>;\n}\n\n#[async_trait]\npub trait ObjectStorePutExt: Send + Sync + 'static {\n   /// Write the bytes at the given location in object store\n   async fn put_bytes(&self, src: &Path, bytes: Bytes) -> Result<()>;\n}\n\n#[async_trait]\npub trait ObjectStoreDeleteExt: Send + Sync + 'static {\n   /// Delete the object at the given location in object store\n   async fn delete_object(&self, src: &Path) -> Result<()>;\n}\n\nFor cleanly switching between signed and unsigned implementations, our usage functions needed to be modified a bit as well:\n\n/// Read object at the given path from input store using either signed or \n/// unsigned store implementation\npub async fn get<S: ObjectStoreGetExt>(store: &S, src: &Path) -> Result<Bytes>;\n\n/// Returns true if object exists at the given path\npub async fn exists<S: ObjectStoreGetExt>(store: &S, src: &Path) -> bool;\n\n/// Write object at the given path. There is no unsigned put implmenetation\n/// because writing an object requires permissioned user signing requests\npub async fn put<S: ObjectStorePutExt>(store: &S, src: &Path, bytes: Bytes) -> Result<()>;\n\nWe then implemented the signed (by falling back to the object store library we were already using) and unsigned implementations (leveraging individual cloud providers' REST APIs) of the above traits: \n\n/// Implementation for making signed requests using object store lib\n#[async_trait]\nimpl ObjectStoreGetExt for Arc<DynObjectStore> {\n   async fn get_bytes(&self, src: &Path) -> Result<Bytes> {\n       self.get(src)\n           .await?\n           .bytes()\n           .await\n           .map_err(|e| anyhow!(\"Failed to get file: {} with error: {}\", src, e.to_string()))\n   }\n}\n\n/// Implementation for making unsigned requests to [Amazon \n/// S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).\n#[derive(Debug)]\npub struct AmazonS3 {\n   /// Http client wrapper which makes unsigned requests for S3 resources\n   client: Arc<S3Client>,\n}\n\n#[async_trait]\nimpl ObjectStoreGetExt for AmazonS3 {\n   async fn get_bytes(&self, location: &Path) -> Result<Bytes> {\n       let result = self.client.get(location).await?;\n       let bytes = result.bytes().await?;\n       Ok(bytes)\n   }\n}\n\n/// Implementation for making unsigned requests to [Google Cloud \n/// Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/).\n#[derive(Debug)]\npub struct GoogleCloudStorage {\n   /// Http client wrapper which makes unsigned requests for gcs resources\n   client: Arc<GoogleCloudStorageClient>,\n}\n\n#[async_trait]\nimpl ObjectStoreGetExt for GoogleCloudStorage {\n   async fn get_bytes(&self, location: &Path) -> Result<Bytes> {\n       let result = self.client.get(location).await?;\n       let bytes = result.bytes().await?;\n       Ok(bytes)\n   }\n}\npub struct ObjectStoreConfig {\n  /// Which object store to use i.e. S3, GCS, etc\n  #[serde(skip_serializing_if = \"Option::is_none\")]\n  #[arg(value_enum)]\n  pub object_store: Option<ObjectStoreType>,\n  /// Name of the bucket to use for the object store. Must also set\n  /// `--object-store` to a cloud object storage to have any effect.\n  #[serde(skip_serializing_if = \"Option::is_none\")]\n  #[arg(long)]\n  pub bucket: Option<String>,\n  #[serde(default)]\n  #[arg(long, default_value_t = false)]\n  pub no_sign_request: bool,\n  ...\n}\n\nimpl ObjectStoreConfig {\n  pub fn make_signed(&self) -> Result<Arc<DynObjectStore>, anyhow::Error> {\n    match &self.object_store {\n      Some(ObjectStoreType::File) => self.new_local_fs(),\n      Some(ObjectStoreType::S3) => self.new_s3(),\n      Some(ObjectStoreType::GCS) => self.new_gcs(),\n      _ => Err(anyhow!(\"At least one backed is needed\")),\n    }\n  }\n}\n\npub trait ObjectStoreConfigExt {\n   fn make_unsigned(&self) -> Result<Arc<dyn ObjectStoreGetExt>>;\n}\n\nimpl ObjectStoreConfigExt for ObjectStoreConfig {\n   fn make_unsigned(&self) -> Result<Arc<dyn ObjectStoreGetExt>> {\n       match self.object_store {\n           Some(ObjectStoreType::S3) => {\n               let bucket_endpoint = { };\n               Ok(AmazonS3::new(&bucket_endpoint).map(Arc::new)?)\n           }\n           Some(ObjectStoreType::GCS) => {\n               let bucket_endpoint = { };\n               Ok(GoogleCloudStorage::new(&bucket_endpoint)).map(Arc::new)?)\n           }\n           _ => Err(anyhow!(\"At least one backend is needed\")),\n       }\n   }\n}\n\nWith all of the above in place, we could cleanly switch between signed and unsigned implementations based on the user provided configuration:\n\nlet store: Arc<dyn ObjectStoreGetExt> = if store_config.no_sign_request {\n  store_config.make_unsigned()?\n} else {\n  store_config.make_signed().map(Arc::new)?\n}; \n\nWe were close to our objective of supporting zero authentication snapshot downloads but not there yet. One last challenge involved the lack of a means to list files in an R2 bucket without signing requests (it is possible to allow public, unsigned list access on S3). And we are required to list files in a RocksDB snapshot directory before downloading it. We fixed this problem by adding a MANIFEST file with all file paths during the snapshot creation process. This MANIFEST is now the source of truth for all files and their relative paths in a snapshot directory.\n\nFinal result\n\nIn the end, by allowing R2 as the default snapshot download option we were able to reduce the cost of serving these snapshots by ~70 to 80 percent, in addition to lowering the barriers for starting and failing over nodes within the Sui network.\n\nNote: This content is for general educational and informational purposes only and should not be construed or relied upon as an endorsement or recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any asset, investment or financial product and does not constitute financial, legal, or tax advice.\n\nREAD NEXT\nThe Top 3 Mobile Wallets on Sui\nMobile wallets are crucial to increasing adoption and accessibility.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAY 15, 2024\nMysticeti Set to Supercharge Consensus on Sui\nA new design for blockchain consensus reduces latency below Sui's already record-breaking speeds.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 10, 2024\nTencent Blockchain RPC Service Now Supports Sui\nSui developers will find a variety of plans supporting apps of all sizes.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 28, 2024\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

To start using these applications, you'll need a wallet. A wallet lets you perform various actions such as buying, selling, sending, and receiving digital assets, including SUI, NFTs, and other ecosystem tokens. Wallets are commonly available as browser extensions, mobile apps, or both.\n\nApproaching nearly a year since Sui's Mainnet launch, several wallets have emerged as popular choices within the Sui ecosystem. In no particular order, we present the top five wallets on Sui.\n\nSuiet\n\nSuiet provides a browser extension wallet featuring a sleek and Sui-themed user interface. Additionally, Suiet offers the Suiet Wallet Kit, enabling seamless integration for apps to connect with any Sui wallet – an essential tool for app developers within the Sui ecosystem.\n\nSui Wallet\n\nDeveloped by Mysten Labs, a core contributor to Sui, the Sui Wallet comes as a browser extension or mobile wallet for Android and iOS. It enables users to create accounts using traditional mnemonics and Web2 credentials, such as Google, via zkLogin.\n\nEthos Wallet\n\nEthos Wallet provides a browser extension wallet integrated with zkLogin, enabling users to create accounts using familiar Web2 credentials. Additionally, Ethos developed 8192, a version of the popular 2048 game built entirely on-chain. The EthosConnect feature facilitates app connections with any Sui wallet.\n\nSurf Wallet\n\nOne of the first to implement zkLogin, Surf Wallet offers both mobile and browser extension wallets. At the time of writing, Surf Wallet is the most widely used mobile wallet within the Sui ecosystem.\n\nNightly\n\nDespite being one of the most recent additions to the Sui ecosystem, Nightly has been actively adding new and exciting features. For instance, Nightly introduces the ability for users to set a specific time window for transactions on a particular app to be automatically confirmed, eliminating the need for manual approval. Currently in beta and exclusive to Aftermath, this feature enables users to opt-in for immediate transaction submission. Nightly offers both browser and mobile wallets, catering to all Sui users.\n\nChoosing your Sui wallet\n\nWhile numerous wallets are available within the ecosystem, some are tailored for specific purposes and may not see widespread use. As the ecosystem continues to expand, wallets may emerge and fade, but the key is to find a wallet that suits your preferences. \n\nAs you explore the range of wallet options available, consider factors such as user interface, features, and login options. Take the time to explore different wallets, experiment with them, and select one that best fits your needs and enhances your overall user experience.\n\n\n\n\nNote: This content is for general educational and informational purposes only and should not be construed or relied upon as an endorsement or recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any asset, investment or financial product and does not constitute financial, legal, or tax advice.\n\nREAD NEXT\nThe Top 3 Mobile Wallets on Sui\nMobile wallets are crucial to increasing adoption and accessibility.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAY 15, 2024\nMysticeti Set to Supercharge Consensus on Sui\nA new design for blockchain consensus reduces latency below Sui's already record-breaking speeds.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 10, 2024\nTencent Blockchain RPC Service Now Supports Sui\nSui developers will find a variety of plans supporting apps of all sizes.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 28, 2024\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

      "url": "https://blog.sui.io/kiosk-revolutionizing-digital-asset-transfers/",
      "html": "Sui.io\nHome\nAbout\nContribute an Article\nINFRASTRUCTURE\nSui Kiosk Demystified: Revolutionizing Digital Asset Transfers\nSui Foundation\nFeb 22, 2024\n3 min\n\nSui's Kiosk primitive enables secure asset transfers with greater control.\n\nThe occasionally adversarial world of blockchain technology makes safeguarding and exchanging digital assets crucial. Sui's Kiosk, a powerful primitive revolutionizing the storage, trading, and protection of digital assets, gives asset creators and owners security and control. Sui Kiosk can be compared to an escrow service, particularly in its role as a mediator or custodian for transactions involving digital assets. Both Sui Kiosk and traditional escrow services provide a mechanism for securing assets during a transaction until specific conditions are met.\n\nUnderstanding the basics\n\nAt its core, a Kiosk is an object owned by an individual wishing to trade an asset, such as an NFT, serving as a location for storing digital assets to be sold securely on the Sui network. The individual selling the asset retains administrative control over the Kiosk and the objects within it. Digital assets stored within a Kiosk, while technically owned by the Kiosk object, can continue to be used in certain interactions, such as being deposited in specific DeFi apps, until the object is purchased from the Kiosk.\n\nFeatures and functionality\n\nOne of the key features of a Kiosk is its ability to allow the owner to set specific permissions for accessing the assets they are selling. For example, an owner may dictate that an object within the Kiosk can only be accessed by individuals willing to pay 100 SUI. This is a simple example of what abilities Sui Kiosk enables for the trading of digital assets.\n\nEnd users require no additional knowledge or tools to interact with a Kiosk. Much like other Sui primitives, such as programmable transaction blocks, users do not need to be conscious of Sui Kiosk when using it.\n\nFor developers integrating Sui Kiosk, the process is streamlined and straightforward because it's native to the protocol. Dedicated functions are available for creating a Kiosk, adding objects to it, and listing items for sale, alongside other more specific functions. Those interested in delving deeper into implementing Sui Kiosk or understanding its workings can refer to the Sui Kiosk docs.\n\nEmpowering creators\n\nFor creators, Sui Kiosk offers robust enforcement mechanisms for transfer policies, safeguarding their assets and asserting ownership rights. Creators have the authority to establish transfer policies tailored to their specific needs, thereby exerting greater control over how their creations are utilized within the Sui ecosystem.\n\nThe transfer policy of an object is established by the account that publishes that particular object type. For example, if you, as a creator, publish a smart contract on Sui to introduce a new object type for your in-game item, you have the authority to define the transfer policy applicable to all objects of that type. Users engaging in the trading of these objects through Sui Kiosk must comply with the transfer policy. However, they can further specify criteria, such as a designated purchase price, using a kiosk as long as it aligns with the boundaries set by the transfer policy.\n\nFurthermore, Sui Kiosk empowers creators to enforce a wide range of behaviors on any type of asset, including but not limited to multiple royalty policies, minimum or maximum trading thresholds, exclusive marketplace sales, and time-bound trading windows. This versatility ensures that creators can protect their intellectual property, effectively regulate distribution, and establish unique asset properties related to transfers specific to their creations.\n\nEnhanced security and trust\n\nOne of the most significant advantages of Sui Kiosk is its inherent security features, which mitigate the risk of unauthorized access and potential exploits. By leveraging native ownership and transfer functionalities, the Sui Kiosk standard ensures that digital assets are protected against malicious activities, including wallet drain attacks and other unauthorized transfers.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Sui Kiosk acts similarly to an escrow service, providing users with confidence that their assets are secure and inaccessible to malicious actors who don't meet the Kiosk criteria. Additionally, this setup creates a separation between the trade and the Kiosk creator's other assets.\n\nToken approvals, typically used on conventional blockchains, often entail significant security risks and vulnerabilities and can lead to wallet drain attacks and similar threats. These approvals typically entail granting unlimited access, making them susceptible to exploitation by malicious contracts or individuals exploiting bugs in innocent contracts. Moreover, such approvals can be exploited at any point between approval and explicit revocation.\n\nMajor Sui marketplaces built on top of the Sui Kiosk standard provide users with a seamless and secure trading experience. Software development kits, wallets, and blockchain explorers are equipped to interface with the Sui Kiosk standard, thereby enhancing interoperability and trust across the ecosystem.\n\nSecure digital asset ownership for all\n\nBy adopting Sui Kiosk, users unlock trust, transparency, and efficiency in the world of digital asset management. With its strong security measures, customizable policies, and seamless integration with marketplaces, Sui Kiosk empowers all personas within the ecosystem.\n\nSui Kiosk represents a pioneering solution to the challenges of asset ownership and exchange in decentralized ecosystems. Its adoption not only enhances security and trust but also fosters a more dynamic and inclusive environment for creators, traders, and enthusiasts alike. \n\n\n\nNote: This content is for general educational and informational purposes only and should not be construed or relied upon as an endorsement or recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any asset, investment or financial product and does not constitute financial, legal, or tax advice.\n\nREAD NEXT\nThe Top 3 Mobile Wallets on Sui\nMobile wallets are crucial to increasing adoption and accessibility.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAY 15, 2024\nMysticeti Set to Supercharge Consensus on Sui\nA new design for blockchain consensus reduces latency below Sui's already record-breaking speeds.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 10, 2024\nTencent Blockchain RPC Service Now Supports Sui\nSui developers will find a variety of plans supporting apps of all sizes.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 28, 2024\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

And the Karrier One team decided on Sui technology to help build out its ground-breaking network.\n\nKarrier One has three main objectives:\n\nBuild a mobile network platform that enables wireless connectivity in underserved communities; at the same time, improve densification, which means getting reliable coverage into highly dense, populated areas, such as underground garages, campuses, and malls\nProvide telecommunications and phone numbers to users within Web3\nCreate the ability to transfer money simply using phone numbers, not bank accounts\n\n“We can unlock connectivity for the whole world,” said co-founder and Chief Operating Officer Andrew El’Lithy. “That's what we’re looking for: seamless connectivity all throughout the world.”\n\nIndividuals and businesses can set up nodes and join Karrier One's network, expanding its coverage area, distributing capital costs.\n\nTo do this, they are leveraging the deep experience Karrier One co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Samer Bishay gained from working in traditional telecom, along with cutting-edge technological elements, including Sui’s blockchain and primitives like zkLogin.\n\n“Sui is the accurate blockchain to build on,” said Karrier One co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Andrew Buchanan. “Not only does it have a similar concept to our Karrier One KNS, but Sui offers other important features. For instance, the transaction speed is really good, and when you’re dealing with sending funds, dealing with phone numbers, you want to have that reliability behind the blockchain. Sui really comes with that accuracy that we need.”\n\nBuilding a new kind of network\n\nWith Karrier One Mobile, the company is building a decentralized, carrier-grade telecom network, both by installing its own infrastructure and partnering with other mobile carriers to ensure widespread 5G coverage around the globe. \n\n“We know that there’s a missing component for telecoms today, and that’s putting in the infrastructure,” said El’Lithy. “Infrastructure costs a lot to telecoms and takes a really long time before dates are set, so we are focusing on deployments.”\n\nProfessional deployers work with individuals, property owners, and municipalities to get radios properly installed.\n\nNode operators on the Karrier One network will need to deploy a cellular radio, similar to the Blinq Networks PC-400.\n\nIn order to future-proof the network, Karrier One is incorporating the Sui blockchain. “The Sui blockchain makes it easy for us to do the deployment and prove that data has gone through the network's radios,” said El’Lithy. “Without this, everything would be privatized and centralized. We want to create a platform that does orchestration to make it easier for other users to deploy their radios and access the actual radio access network (RAN).”\n\nBy partnering with a competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) led by Bishay and leveraging zkLogin, a Sui primitive that supports Web2 authorization services, Karrier One is able to offer US and Canadian phone numbers and provide them as NFTs. This NFT model has the added benefit of allowing Karrier One to protect against SIM swap fraud, a common problem in some parts of the world in which people hijack another person’s SIM.\n\nUnbanked payments via Web3\n\nAnother area of focus for Karrier One is mobile payments. \n\n“There’s a huge need for a monetary system that allows unbanked people to send and receive money,” said El’Lithy.\n\nAs inspiration, the team looked to an existing model that’s widely used in Kenya, called M-PESA. There, where much of the population doesn’t have access to banks, it’s common to use a phone number to pay bills and send or receive payments.\n\n“We want to Web3-ify that,” said Nahid Masad, Karrier One’s co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer.\n\nWith Karrier One KNS, people will be able to get a virtual phone number, then send and receive payments tied to that number. But in order for this service to reach a wide audience, the team knew it would be important to make it accessible to people who aren’t yet ready for Web3. \n\n“It’s not that easy to do for the normal layperson who’s not really tech-inclined,” said El’Lithy, “so we have to kind of work backward to go forward. zkLogin plays a huge role in us being able to onboard Web2 users.”\n\nUsing zkLogin as the basis for Karrier One KNS means people can use their Apple ID, Google log-in, or an existing phone number in order to send funds through the platform, similar to how they use the Cash App or Zelle today. “We want Web2 users to feel comfortable using our service, and zkLogin allows us to kind of adopt them into the Web3 world,” said El’Lithy.\n\nStarting rural, and taking it global\n\nInitially, Karrier One will deploy its radios in the United States and Canada, with the goal of reaching underserved communities and bringing connectivity to those long stretches of highway where service frequently drops. They’ve already deployed proof of concept nodes, some of which have been placed in North American indigenous peoples' territories where locals had little to no connectivity. And a forthcoming proof of concept in Newfoundland will include the option for people to purchase Canadian mobile plans. \n\nHowever, the plan is to take the network global.\n\n“One thing we found with a lot of DeWi is that it’s been region-locked specifically to the United States due to reliance on the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS),” said Nahid Masad. “But that locks out the rest of Web3 users, and Web3 is meant to be global.”\n\n“Karrier One KNS gives us the ability to reach out to the entire Web3 community and tap into that global community to provide a service that anyone can use,” said El’Lithy. \n\nREAD NEXT\nThe Top 3 Mobile Wallets on Sui\nMobile wallets are crucial to increasing adoption and accessibility.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAY 15, 2024\n5 Games Coming to Sui: A Glimpse into the Future of Gaming\nNew gaming experiences are created on Sui and numerous games are launching this year!\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 22, 2024\nSui funds University Researchers from KAIST, UCL, National University of Singapore\nSui Academic Research Awards provides funding to 17 researchers pushing the boundaries of blockchain-related technologies.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 14, 2024\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

As a stablecoin-alternative, USDY's value is tied to the US dollar on a one-to-one basis, while also earning yields for owners, which in the current formulation adds to the price of the token. \n\nOndo Finance, creator of the USDY stablecoin alternative, backs the coin with short-term US Treasuries and bank demand deposits. The coin name stands for US Dollar Yield, signifying its yield-bearing feature. \n\nStablecoins such as USDC and USDT, a category similar to USDY, can be traded on Sui. However, these are non-native coins bridged to the network and wrapped in a smart contract to make them tradable on Sui DEXes. \n\nOver the past six months, data analytics site Wormholescan showed that over $300 million in assets has been bridged from Ethereum to Sui, accounting for 64 percent of all coins bridged from Ethereum through Wormhole. Of the existing wrapped USDC and USDT stablecoins, Wormholescan shows Sui emits $46 million of the former and $18 million of the latter, making it a top venue for these stablecoins. \n\nThe availability of USDY on Sui gives DeFi users a coin option tied to the value of the US dollar and accruing interest. \n\nNote: This content is for general educational and informational purposes only and should not be construed or relied upon as an endorsement or recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any asset, investment or financial product and does not constitute financial, legal, or tax advice.\n\nREAD NEXT\nzkLogin Adds Multi-sig Recovery, Apple Credentials\nAn update to zkLogin further extends its capabilities, giving users new options and adding use cases.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAY 9, 2024\nFirst Digital Stablecoin Debuting on Sui\nFDUSD, a stablecoin previously only offered on Ethereum and BNB Chain, expands its horizons on Sui.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 11, 2024\nMysticeti Set to Supercharge Consensus on Sui\nA new design for blockchain consensus reduces latency below Sui's already record-breaking speeds.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 10, 2024\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

Athens Exchange Group, the company behind ATHEX, will work with Mysten Labs, Sui's original contributor, to develop the technology.\n\nEBB, a fund-raising feature of ATHEX, lets early stage and mature companies list transferable securities. As a meta-layer over ATHEX's existing trading order routing system, EBB offers liquidity for business proposals of companies seeking funds.\n\nFor its part, Sui could host ATHEX securities minted as digital certificates. In this form they would be protected by strong security and transferable, with a transparent chain of custody. Although blockchain technology seems a natural fit for stock market mechanisms such as EBB, this deployment would be the first of its kind.\n\nSui's ability to scale and process transactions in parallel, reaching industry-leading throughput, offers ATHEX the performance it requires to serve its customers.\n\nIn addition, decentralized infrastructure, such as Sui and the Internet as a whole, are resistant to outages due to the multitude of nodes supporting the network. If a few nodes fail, transactions can still be processed by the remaining nodes. This type of resilience ensures that ATHEX's users will not be subject to outages that could affect their investments.\n\nAt this time, the project is only in an evaluation phase, and will depend on its performance and ATHEX's willingness to host an important feature on blockchain technology. \n\nNote: This content is for general educational and informational purposes only and should not be construed or relied upon as an endorsement or recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any asset, investment or financial product and does not constitute financial, legal, or tax advice.\n\nREAD NEXT\nThe Top 3 Mobile Wallets on Sui\nMobile wallets are crucial to increasing adoption and accessibility.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAY 15, 2024\n5 Games Coming to Sui: A Glimpse into the Future of Gaming\nNew gaming experiences are created on Sui and numerous games are launching this year!\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 22, 2024\nSui funds University Researchers from KAIST, UCL, National University of Singapore\nSui Academic Research Awards provides funding to 17 researchers pushing the boundaries of blockchain-related technologies.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 14, 2024\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

      "html": "Sui.io\nHome\nAbout\nContribute an Article\nDEFI\nAll About Digital Identity\nSui Foundation\nMar 7, 2024\n4 min\n\nDigital identity leverages decentralized technology to create better identity solutions.\n\nThe potential for misuse and abuse of personal information in today's digital environment requires establishing robust identity verification mechanisms. Traditional centralized systems, the current norm for identity management, come with inherent risks, such as single points of failure and exposure to hacking. In contrast, Sui offers a promising alternative by providing decentralized and secure solutions backed by strong cryptography for managing digital identities.\n\nWhat is digital identity?\n\nDigital identity encompasses the digital representation of an individual, entity, or object. It comprises various attributes, including personal information, credentials, permissions, and affiliations, which are stored and managed electronically. These online attributes range from home addresses to bank account numbers, and even include social media activity.\n\nUnlike traditional forms of identity, such as physical identification cards or documents, digital identities are dynamic, interoperable, and capable of facilitating trust and authentication in online interactions.\n\nDigital identity solutions built on a decentralized network leverage the unique capabilities and robust security to create much more secure and usable protocols. Utilizing technology like zero-knowledge proofs, digital identity solutions provide the assurances needed for securing critical data related to identity.\n\nThe importance of name services\n\nAt the heart of many blockchain-based digital identity solutions lie name services. These services provide users with unique identifiers linked to their digital identities. SuiNS, one such name service, allows users to associate human-readable names with Sui addresses. Instead of relying on long, complex addresses composed of letters and numbers, users can simply use their SuiNS names to send and receive transactions, enhancing usability and accessibility.\n\nName services play a crucial role in simplifying the user experience and promoting widespread adoption of blockchain technology. Providing a human-readable layer on top of blockchain addresses makes interactions with blockchain more intuitive for both novice and experienced users. Additionally, name services enable seamless integration with existing infrastructure, opening up new possibilities for blockchain apps and services.\n\nHowever, name services are just one piece of the puzzle in blockchain-based digital identity solutions. Users need additional services to fully address the complexities of identity management in the digital realm. \n\nKey components of digital identity\n\nAuthentication services: These services verify the authenticity of individuals or entities accessing digital resources. Through mechanisms such as multi-factor authentication or biometric verification, authentication services help prevent unauthorized access and protect user identities from being compromised.\n\nCredential management: Digital identities often require various credentials, such as government-issued IDs, academic certificates, or professional licenses. Credential management services enable users to securely store, manage, and selectively disclose these credentials as needed, ensuring trust and authenticity in online interactions.\n\nPrivacy-preserving solutions: Privacy is a fundamental aspect of digital identity, and blockchain-based solutions must prioritize user privacy while maintaining transparency and auditability. Techniques such as zero-knowledge proofs, employed by Sui's zkLogin, and decentralized identity enable users to confirm their identity without revealing sensitive information, empowering them to control their digital footprint.\n\nInteroperability standards: In a fragmented digital landscape, interoperability standards are essential for seamless communication and integration between different identity systems. Standards like Decentralized Identity Foundation specifications and W3C Verifiable Credentials provide a common framework for building interoperable and extensible identity solutions across diverse platforms and ecosystems. These standards dramatically simplify processes which require identity information from external sources.\n\nGovernance mechanisms: Decentralized governance models ensure the integrity and reliability of identity systems by involving stakeholders in decision-making processes. Through mechanisms such as decentralized autonomous organizations and token-based voting, governance ensures transparency, accountability, and community-driven development of identity protocols and standards. [is there an example we can include?]\n\nBy combining these components with name services, blockchain-based digital identity solutions offer a comprehensive framework for managing identities in the digital age. These solutions empower individuals to take ownership of their identities, protect their privacy, and participate in trusted interactions without relying on centralized authorities or intermediaries.\n\nDigital identity applications\n\nIn the financial services sector, digital identity facilitates streamlined onboarding processes, know your customer procedures, and secure transactions. It enables individuals to access banking services, apply for loans, and conduct cross-border payments more efficiently while mitigating the risk of fraud and identity theft.\n\nIn healthcare, digital identity solutions enhance patient data management, medical records interoperability, and identity verification for healthcare providers. Patients can securely access their health information, grant consent for treatment, and engage in telemedicine consultations while maintaining confidentiality and compliance with regulatory standards.\n\nWithin supply chain management, digital identity plays a crucial role in enabling source tracking, product authentication, and transparency. It ensures the integrity and authenticity of goods, mitigates counterfeit risks, and enhances traceability and accountability in global trade networks.\n\nGovernments leverage digital identity solutions to deliver citizen-centric services, streamline administrative processes, and enhance e-government initiatives. Digital identities let citizens access online government portals, vote in elections, and securely interact with public institutions while safeguarding privacy and data protection rights.\n\nThe future of digital identity\n\nAs blockchain technology continues to evolve and digital ecosystems continue to grow, the future of digital identity holds immense promise. Innovations such as self-sovereign identity, decentralized identifiers, and verifiable credentials pave the way for more secure, privacy-enhancing, and user-centric identity solutions. \n\nSui offers a far higher level of security than traditional Internet-based networks. The network nodes that make up Sui verify transaction legitimacy. Strong cryptography protects accounts and digital assets. The network makes ownership and provenance of digital assets transparent. \n\nEmpowering individuals with control over their digital identities and fostering trust in online interactions are central pillars of Sui and driving forces shaping the future of digital identity in the decentralized Web3 era.\n\n\n\n\nNote: This content is for general educational and informational purposes only and should not be construed or relied upon as an endorsement or recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any asset, investment or financial product and does not constitute financial, legal, or tax advice.\n\nREAD NEXT\nThe Top 3 Mobile Wallets on Sui\nMobile wallets are crucial to increasing adoption and accessibility.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAY 15, 2024\nFirst Digital Stablecoin Debuting on Sui\nFDUSD, a stablecoin previously only offered on Ethereum and BNB Chain, expands its horizons on Sui.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 11, 2024\nDeepBook Previews Token Launch with NFT Airdrop\nDeepBook NFT recipients will be able to claim the DEEP token when it launches.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 2, 2024\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

With Studio Mirai, the research and development studio they co-founded, they’re exploring the intersections between Web3 technology and creative industries.\n\nTamashi, Studio Mirai’s first profile picture (PFP) project, exists within Nozomi World, a rich, fictional world created to give a captivating backstory to all three PFP collections the company has in the works. In addition to providing the team with a fun and interesting way to conduct research and development for its products, these PFP collections also helped Studio Mirai create a highly engaged community in the NFT space and build a foundation for pushing out future projects.\n\nTamashi, Studio Mirai's first NFT project, let the team explore the possibilities of blockchain technology.\n\nIts flagship product, Coda, is currently in development and aims to shake up the music industry with a platform that brings artists and fans closer with blockchain-powered tools.\n\nCoda is an ambitious vision. And when the brothers launched Studio Mirai about three years ago, predominant blockchain technology wasn’t up to the task of bringing it to life.\n\n“My experience building on other chains was not great, because you have to conform to the standards on those chains,” said Brian Li, Studio Mirai’s Chief Technology Officer. “So when we were building out the music platform, as well as certain features for our collections, it turned out to be very difficult–if not impossible–to do on existing chains.”\n\nAfter initially launching on one chain and experimenting with another, Li decided to move the entire operation over to Sui. \n\n“On Sui, we’re able to imagine something and then just capture that in code,” he said.\n\nUsing Sui, Studio Mirai found many tools to make its NFT projects more engaging.\n\nThe biggest game changer for Studio Mirai has been Sui’s object-based data model. While most blockchains use an account-based model, a legacy of their focus on cryptocurrency, Sui is fundamentally different. With a computing environment where everything is expressed as an object and one object can own another, Sui gives developers much more freedom.\n\n“On other chains, there was no way to build an object,” said Li. “There was a standard, which could make it seem like you’re building an object, but at the core, you’re not. And it was just very difficult to get around that.”\n\nBut the object-based model isn’t the only Sui technology benefiting Studio Mirai. Fast path transactions, shared objects for account abstraction, transfer to object, onchain hashing, dynamic NFTs, and zkLogin all contribute to Studio Mirai’s projects. \n\n“We’re pretty much using every feature available to us,” said Li.\n\nPFPs in a world of hope\n\nWhen Studio Mirai decided to launch their PFP collections, they wanted to have more than just the usual set of complementary pictures. So one team member wrote a story, based in the fictional city of Nozomi (meaning “hope” in Japanese), to give depth and meaning to the characters they illustrated.\n\nLeveraging Sui's dynamic NFT technology, Studio Mirai developed NFTs that can be upgraded from black and white to color.\n\nStudio Mirai offers three PFP collections, all linked to the world of Nozomi. Tamashi, the original collection, consists of 100 one-of-one PFPs, which was released on another chain and will be migrating to Sui this year. Prime Machin, the team’s first dynamic collection to be launched on Sui, will be minting early this year. The manga-inspired Prime Machin collection leverages several Sui technologies in innovative ways, such as fast path transactions, transfer to object, and storage rebates for storing 4K full-resolution images onchain. In addition, Sui’s dynamic NFT capabilities will allow images in this collection to transform from black and white to color. Enforcer Machin, the next dynamic collection on Sui, will leverage object composability to allow swappable traits and real-time 3D rendering.\n\nBringing musicians and fans into harmony\n\nAn even more ambitious project is Coda, a music platform Studio Mirai hopes will bring some of the power back to artists and deepen connections between musicians and their fans.\n\n“We feel like blockchain has a lot of potential to solve many things,” said Li. “I think blockchain is most useful in situations where there’s an imbalance of power. And the music world is perhaps the best example of this.”\n\n“I think blockchain is most useful in situations where there’s an imbalance of power. And the music world is perhaps the best example of this.”\n\nLi cites the expense of making music in the last century as the source of many problems that still persist in the industry today. Because studio time and equipment, record pressings, promotion, and touring were so expensive, musicians had little control. They had to work with a large company to get their music made and sold.\n\n“In that kind of environment, it’s very easy for these large companies to abuse their power,” said Li. “So people get bad deals, payments are slow, concert tickets are very expensive. And the power lies with the entities between the artists and the fans.\" \n\n“Blockchain is a technology that could potentially change that,” he added. “Now we have a permissionless system that can act as that thing in between them. That was really the inspiration for this platform.”\n\nAnd while the team conceived of the Coda platform years prior, they were forced to shelve development on it when existing blockchains couldn’t support their model. It wasn’t until they stumbled upon Sui in 2022 that they realized what was finally possible.\n\n“I dug into the docs and saw the ability to create custom types that actually live in a wallet instead of just in a contract, the ability to customize the permissions aspect of the object itself,” said Li. “I told my brother ‘This is exactly what we need to build what we want.’”\n\nThe team envisions Coda as a platform that can connect musicians and fans in three ways: publishing and selling albums, selling concert tickets, and giving artists more direct insight into their fans.\n\nCoda will allow artists to persist their records and accept payments through Sui.\n\nCoda will allow artists to persist their records and accept payments through Sui. This design lets artists set their own album prices and helps avoid the often inscrutable, slow payment process associated with modern streaming platforms. \n\nAn NFT-based ticketing platform would allow artists to sell tickets to their live shows. Artists could specify how much their tickets are sold for both on the primary market and the secondary market, a move designed to address the scalping problem. Sui's Kiosk primitive lets Studio Mirai build in the logic where artists can set both the primary and secondary prices. In addition, dynamic NFTs as tickets can change their visual aspect once they've been redeemed for entry to a show.\n\n“Now, once a new show goes up, bots will buy up tickets and scalpers will then try to sell them for two or three times the original price,” said Li. “That’s not good for the fans. It’s only good for the scalpers and the marketplace, which answers to their shareholders.”\n\nFinally, the team is working to give artists insight into their fans. Li cites the frustrations of artists who have no way to know who is attending their live shows, streaming their songs, or buying their merch. They want the platform to give artists a way to find engaged fans and send them a discount on an upcoming show or album, for example, while not disclosing any specific information about those fans. Using Sui, Studio Mirai can send any number of digital promotional items to accounts that redeemed NFT-based concert tickets.\n\nThe move to Sui\n\nAlthough moving their Nozomi PFPs and Coda over to Sui took effort, the team was pleasantly surprised at how quickly they were able to get up and running. Li anticipated a six- to eight-week ramp-up time. Instead, once he got to work, he was able to begin deploying on Sui within 12 hours. And the move has enabled them to actually start building a platform that meets their grand vision.\n\n“Sui is probably the only chain that’s suitable to build a consumer app,” said Li. “And that’s almost exclusively due to the fact that Sui has programmable transaction blocks, where you’re able to bundle a bunch of different actions into one package that can be submitted at once and then that’s processed as one thing.”\n\nHe gives an example of breaking a music recording down into six tiers, where each tier is an object that owns the previous tier. Sui allows them to create the complete tokenized record in a single programmable transaction, whereas other chains that don’t support this feature would require time to wait for each subsequent block. \n\n“So an interaction that might take half a second on Sui might end up taking 10 seconds on a different chain, even if there’s a fast block time,” said Li. “These programmable transaction blocks abstract away transaction speed as something that devs need to think about.”\n\nWith Sui as its foundation, Studio Mirai will continue to push the boundaries of where the creative arts can go. \n\nREAD NEXT\nThe Top 3 Mobile Wallets on Sui\nMobile wallets are crucial to increasing adoption and accessibility.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAY 15, 2024\n5 Games Coming to Sui: A Glimpse into the Future of Gaming\nNew gaming experiences are created on Sui and numerous games are launching this year!\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 22, 2024\nSui funds University Researchers from KAIST, UCL, National University of Singapore\nSui Academic Research Awards provides funding to 17 researchers pushing the boundaries of blockchain-related technologies.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 14, 2024\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

      "title": "Scaling Out Sui Execution with Pilotfish",
      "url": "https://blog.sui.io/pilotfish-execution-scalability-blockchain/",
      "html": "Sui.io\nHome\nAbout\nContribute an Article\nINFRASTRUCTURE\nScaling Out Sui Execution with Pilotfish\nMysten Labs\nMar 20, 2024\n8 min\n\nNew research paves the way for the Sui blockchain to enable Validators to scale in support of vastly increased execution performance.\n\nPilotfish, the first multi-machine smart contract execution engine, enables Sui network validators to use multiple machines and autoscale to execute more transactions when the load increases. This is achieved without compromising reliability or feature completeness. \n\nPilotfish recovers from failures of internal execution machines and supports the Sui's full dynamic operations. Its streaming architecture leads to a very low latency overhead. Our performance evaluations of the Pilotfish integration with Sui demonstrate an up to eight times throughput increase when using eight servers for execution, demonstrating linear scaling for compute-bound loads. \n\nThe challenge of execution\n\nLazy blockchains are a promising emerging design architecture that decouples transaction ordering (consensus) and execution. In this design, an ordering layer sequences transactions, and then, at a later time, an execution layer executes the transaction sequence. This enables state-of-the-art blockchain systems to order a large number of transactions (on the order of 100,000 transactions per second), using modern consensus algorithms such as Bullshark and Hammerhead. However, execution performance has been lagging behind, and nowadays execution is the bottleneck. For example, the Ethereum virtual machine is reported to peak at only 20,000 transactions per second when executing simple transactions.\n\nBatching: A high-latency solution\n\nOne solution to the execution bottleneck is batching. By constructing batches or blocks of a large number of transactions and submitting them as a unit to be executed, it is possible to achieve high throughput without major changes to the architecture. However, batching comes at the cost of high latency. It is not uncommon for batched execution to have latency in the hundreds of milliseconds, which is non-negligible for low-latency blockchains such as Sui. \n\nPilotfish achieves high throughput while only introducing a negligible latency overhead, in the range of tens of milliseconds rather than hundreds, following the established stream-processing approach already employed in Sui for multi-core execution.\n\nScaling up versus scaling out\n\nOne way to achieve high throughput while keeping latency low is scaling up. Parallel transaction execution on a single machine, and some blockchains, including Sui, successfully employ this model. It has the advantage of not requiring huge architectural changes. The validator is already entirely located on a single machine, making it just a question of executing the transaction in parallel instead of sequentially while preserving transaction causality. \n\nWith the scale up approach, once the current load is beyond what your current machine can handle, your only choice is to upgrade to a more powerful machine. But this solution has a limited runway. There are only so many CPU cores that can fit in a server, so much RAM, etc. So if the load keeps growing, eventually it will be beyond the means of any single machine to keep up. Adding insult to injury, it is not only the CPU that might be exhausted but any single resource of the machine. Even if the current validator machine is not saturated CPU-wise for the current load, it might run out of RAM capacity and be forced to rely on slow persistent storage, thus slowing down the entire pipeline. Finally, relying on single powerful machines is unfriendly to the blockchain space, as beefy machines are rare and supported by only a few data-center providers. \n\nThe only other way to solve the execution bottleneck, which Pilotfish pioneers in the blockchain space, is scaling out through distributed transaction execution on multiple machines. The advantage of the scale out approach is that it has the potential to scale indefinitely. When load increases beyond the capacity of the current number of machines, we can just spin up more machines, essentially guaranteeing that we never run out of capacity and never have to resort to slow, persistent storage on the critical path. Another advantage of this approach is that it is orthogonal to, and compatible with, the scale up approach. Finally, it also allows for easier decentralization, preventing hardware provider “monoculture.” There is a larger market for multiple small machines than for single super-powerful machines.\n\nHow Pilotfish works\n\nHere is how Pilotfish distributes transaction execution on multiple machines. Each validator is internally split into three logical roles: (1) the Primary, which handles consensus, (2) SequencingWorkers (SWs), which store transactions and dispatch them for execution; and (3) ExecutionWorkers (EWs), which store the blockchain state and execute transactions received from the SWs. \n\nA potential Pilotfish deployment uses a Primary, along with three SequencingWorkers and three ExecutionWorkers.\n\nEach of these roles is instantiated on one or more machines, except for the Primary, which is always a single machine. Note that the machines that compose a validator trust each other (they are run by the same entity), so they do not need heavyweight Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocols to coordinate. Only the Primary requires BFT, when it interacts with other nodes.\n\nWhat allows Pilotfish to scale is that SWs and EWs shard the state. Each transaction is assigned to a single SW and each blockchain object is assigned to a single EW. Note that this is not the same as inter-validator sharding, in which validators are assigned different subsets of the state. In Pilotfish, all validators are assigned the entire state, and the sharding happens inside each validator that uses many machines.\n\nIn a perfect world, each transaction would only access objects from a single shard, so distributing transaction execution would be as simple as dispatching each transaction to its proper EW shard. However, in the real world, transactions will often access objects from more than one shard. To handle such cross-shard transactions, Pilotfish EWs exchange object data on a per-needed basis, so that the EW designated to execute a given transaction always has the required object data before it starts executing.\n\nIn this example deployment of Pilotfish, one SW and three EWs process transactions received by the Primary.\n\nIn the diagram above, the Primary interacts with the primaries of other validators to order transactions (➊). The SW receives the transaction ordering information from the primary and dispatches transactions to the appropriate EWs (➋). In our example above, the current transaction T accesses input objects from shards EW1 and EW3, so the SW only dispatches T to those EWs. Then EW1 and EW3 each schedule T against other transactions that may conflict with T (more about our scheduling algorithm in the full paper) (➌). Once T is ready to execute, EW1 and EW3 send the appropriate object data to the designated executor of T (in this case the designated executor is EW1, so only EW3 needs to send objects). Once EW1 has all the required object data, it executes T (➍) and sends the output effects to all EWs. Each EW applies locally changes to objects it owns (➎).\n\nBeyond the basics\n\nBesides this basic transaction flow, read our full paper to find out:\n\nHow we schedule transactions to allow parallel execution of non-conflicting transactions.\nHow we handle and recover from shard crashes.\nHow we enable reads and writes over dynamic fields.\nA quick look at our results\n\nHere we have a quick look at the experimental results. The paper contains full details of the experimental setup and results. \n\nIn the latency versus throughput graph below, each data point represents an experimental run in which the SequencingWorker submits transactions at a fixed rate for a duration of five minutes. We experimentally increase the load of transactions sent to the system and record the median throughput and latency of executed transactions. As a result, all plots illustrate the steady state latency of all systems under low load as well as the maximal throughput they can serve, after which latency grows quickly. This is the throughput at which the latency shoots up to over 20 milliseconds.\n\nWe emphasize that, in all experiments, transactions are submitted for execution individually, as they arrive in a streaming fashion, without being batched. This is especially important to Sui, which processes fast-path transactions asynchronously as soon as they are certified, before they are batched in a consensus commit. Pilotfish alo supports batching, which significantly increases throughput but (of course) also leads to higher latency.\n\nIn this first workload, each transaction is a simple transfer of coins from one address to another. We generate the transactions such that no two transactions conflict. Each transaction operates on a different set of objects from the other transactions. Thus, this workload is completely parallelizable. \n\nLatency versus throughput with simple transfers: Pilotfish preserves low latency (<20 milliseconds).\n\nWe observe that for any number of execution workers (EW), Pilotfish maintains a low sub-20 millisecond latency envelope. Significantly, we also observe that the per-transaction latency decreases as we add more EWs. At a low 6 to 7 millisecond latency the eight EW configuration processes five to six times more individual transfers than the one EW configuration.\n\nNote that latency exhibits a linear increase as the workload grows for a single ExecutionWorker, primarily because of the effects of transaction queuing. More specifically, a single machine does not have enough cores to fully exploit the parallelism of the workload, so some transactions have to wait to get scheduled. This effect no longer exists for higher numbers of ExecutionWorkers, illustrating that adding more hardware has a beneficial effect on the service time by lowering execution latency.\n\nPilotfish’s scalability is not perfectly linear in this workload. In particular, the marginal improvement in throughput decreases after two ExecutionWorkers. This is due to the computationally light simple transfer workload and throughput not being compute-bound. Thus, adding more CPU resources no longer improves performance proportionally. The next graph, shown below, illustrates the advantages of increasing the number of ExecutionWorkers when the workload is compute-bound.\n\nTo illustrate the effect of computational intensity, we add some synthetic computation to each transaction. For simplicity, we use iterative Fibonacci computation as our synthetic computation. Ror example, in the graph below, “Fib-2500” means that each transaction computes the 2,500th Fibonacci number. The graph shows how the maximum throughput of Pilotfish scales with the number of EWs for three levels of computational intensity (Fib-2500 is the lowest and Fib-10000 is the highest). As a baseline, we include the performance of the Sui baseline, which runs on a single machine and cannot take advantage of additional hardware. \n\nAs the graph shows, in this case, the throughput of Pilotfish scales linearly with the number of EWs available, up to eight times throughput with eight EWs, which is close to ideal. \n\nScalability with a computationally intensive workload: Pilotfish can scale linearly when compute is the bottleneck.\nWhat’s next?\n\nFor now, Pilotfish is a proof-of-concept that shows it is possible to achieve good scale-out execution scalability in lazy blockchains, without compromising latency. In particular, we show that a highly distributed executor leads to low latency execution and higher throughput, even for simple transfers. Furthermore, for compute-intensive smart contracts we demonstrate a near ideal increase in throughput as we add more execution resources. \n\nPilotfish opens up the way for cheaper computation in smart contracts, free of concerns that the execution of one CPU-bound contract would interfere negatively with other smart contracts.\n\nIn the next iteration, we plan to also implement and test support for more than one SW, shard replication and crash-recovery, and support for ultra-fast remote direct memory access networking. We are working on improving our prototype by adding these features and improving its end-to-end performance through engineering optimizations.\n\nREAD NEXT\nThe Top 3 Mobile Wallets on Sui\nMobile wallets are crucial to increasing adoption and accessibility.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAY 15, 2024\nMysticeti Set to Supercharge Consensus on Sui\nA new design for blockchain consensus reduces latency below Sui's already record-breaking speeds.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 10, 2024\nTencent Blockchain RPC Service Now Supports Sui\nSui developers will find a variety of plans supporting apps of all sizes.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 28, 2024\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

Previous blockchains were technically limited in how they could support onchain gaming, but Sui offers the performance and efficiency developers need.\n\nAnd the timing couldn't be more ripe, as industry trends point towards onchain gaming momentum in 2024. A report by Delphi Digital cites a new wave of investment and interest, incentivizing studios to delve deeper into how Web3 and blockchain technology cater to the demands of gamers.\n\nAlthough these Sui primitives serve a variety of use cases, including DeFi and real world assets, they will have a profound impact on onchain gaming. Their synergistic combination showcases a collective capability in enhancing user engagement and experience within the Sui gaming ecosystem.\n\nzkLogin: Simplifying onboarding for gamers\n\nAt the forefront of enhancing user accessibility lies zkLogin, a revolutionary solution addressing the onboarding challenges faced by new gamers venturing into blockchain-based gaming. The cumbersome process of creating and managing new blockchain accounts often deters potential users. However, zkLogin streamlines this process by enabling gamers to securely authenticate and conduct transactions using their existing Web2 credentials.\n\nThis seamless integration with Web2 login credentials not only simplifies onboarding but also fosters a more inclusive environment, catering to gamers of varying levels of blockchain knowledge. By abstracting away blockchain interactions from users, zkLogin significantly enhances the accessibility and usability of onchain games within the Sui ecosystem.\n\nSponsored transactions: Eliminating gas fee friction\n\nSui tackles the burden of blockchain gas fees through sponsored transactions, a primitive alleviating a common onboarding barrier for new users. Traditionally, requiring users to pay fees in the native coin of the underlying blockchain poses a significant barrier to entry for apps. However, sponsored transactions empower game developers to subsidize specific user transactions, abstracting gas fees away from the end-user experience.\n\nThis innovative approach not only reduces onboarding friction but also provides developers with granular control over gas fee subsidization. As opposed to making users pay gas fees as they play a game, developers can enable tried and true revenue models, such as ad-support, subscriptions, and freemium.\n\nProgrammable Transaction Blocks: Streamlining interactions\n\nProgrammable Transaction Blocks (PTBs) dramatically simplify blockchain interactions for both gamers and developers. By enabling the bundling, signing, and submission of complex transactions in a unified process, PTBs streamline interactions within onchain games. This seamless execution of multiple transactions in a single block enhances user experience by ensuring cohesive and atomic processes, mitigating the risk of transaction failures midway through a series of desired interactions.\n\nPTBs empower game developers to create intricate gaming experiences involving multiple apps and interactions within a single transaction block, requiring a single interaction from the user. This fosters a more immersive and seamless gaming environment on Sui.\n\nSui Kiosk: Empowering asset control in gaming\n\nSui Kiosk empowers gamers to retain full control over their in-game assets, even when listed for sale. In traditional gaming environments, users often relinquish ownership-related abilities when trading assets. However, Sui Kiosk facilitates the transfer of asset ownership while allowing creators to define specific policies for asset trading.\n\nFor developers, Sui Kiosk can power an in-game store where characters purchase equipment, or an ecosystem-level trading system where players buy and sell items they find in-game. Developers get to define the trading functionalities and even determine how items function outside of the game. By eliminating the need for additional layers or third-party services, Sui Kiosk simplifies asset trading within onchain games on Sui.\n\nUnlocking the potential of onchain gaming on Sui\n\nSui's innovative primitives are poised to revolutionize the landscape of onchain gaming, offering unparalleled user experiences and fostering a vibrant gaming ecosystem. From simplifying onboarding with zkLogin to eliminating gas fee friction through sponsored transactions, Sui provides an environment for developers to create immersive and frictionless gaming experiences. With PTBs streamlining interactions and Kiosk empowering asset control, Sui is redefining the standard of onchain gaming. \n\nStay tuned for upcoming improvements and new Sui primitives, as the journey towards a new era of onchain gaming continues on Sui!\n\n\n\n\nNote: This content is for general educational and informational purposes only and should not be construed or relied upon as an endorsement or recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any asset, investment or financial product and does not constitute financial, legal, or tax advice.\n\nREAD NEXT\n5 Games Coming to Sui: A Glimpse into the Future of Gaming\nNew gaming experiences are created on Sui and numerous games are launching this year!\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 22, 2024\nSui’s Biggest Gaming Wins of 2023\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of Web3 gaming, Sui stands as a powerful platform, carving a unique path in the industry's transformative journey.

      "html": "Sui.io\nHome\nAbout\nContribute an Article\nANNOUNCEMENTS\nDeepBook Previews Token Launch with NFT Airdrop\nSui Foundation\nApr 2, 2024\n5 min\n\nDeepBook NFT recipients will be able to claim the DEEP token when it launches.\n\nDeepBook, Sui's first native liquidity layer, is launching its own native token, DEEP, reinforcing its position as key financial infrastructure for the Sui network. DEEP is designed for institutions and institutional traders using DeepBook to provide wholesale liquidity in DeFi. The combination of DeepBook and DEEP delivers the preeminent venue in Web3 for sourcing liquidity by DeFi apps. \n\nKey features of the DEEP token include volume-based fees and maker incentives. Participating in those features requires that users reach specific staking thresholds in DeepBook pools. Those users will also contribute to governance of those pools by staking their DEEP tokens.\n\nDeepBook's fully on-chain central limit order book architecture allows DeFi protocols and professional traders to access its pools and offer a range of rich retail services. Along with market token orders, users can place limit orders in DeepBook pools, allowing for sophisticated trading functionality. Deepbook delivers an efficient foundation for DeFi, supporting liquidity and unlocking avenues for innovation in financial products.\n\nThe DEEP token will officially launch later this year. In the meantime, DeepBook developed a unique soulbound NFT, called DBClaimNFT, made available on March 28. Recipients of this NFT will be able to unwrap it and obtain liquid, fungible DEEP tokens upon token launch. \n\nThe DBClaimNFT, distributed on March 28, 2024, shows the quantity of fungible DEEP tokens it can be unwrapped into when the token launches. This NFT cannot be transferred, swapped, or sold.\nDesigned for wholesale trading\n\nThe DEEP token's design incentivizes DeepBook's many diverse participants to work together in offering ample and around-the-clock liquidity, strengthening wholesale liquidity. It will contribute to DeepBook's foundational liquidity for DeFi protocols. This design includes features geared towards institutional users.\n\nVolume-based fees: While anyone can trade on DeepBook, the fees these traders pay decrease incrementally with respect to the trader’s activity in that pool. This allows institutional traders, DeFi protocols, and other active participants to pay low fees on the margin, whereas infrequent traders pay higher fees and would likely use DeFi protocols or brokers instead.\n\nMaker incentives: DeepBook's liquidity providers, called makers, receive extra DeepBook token-denominated incentives, which, in the aggregate, decrease in the amount of total liquidity provided in a given epoch. This allows DeepBook to maintain consistent liquidity depth even in periods that would otherwise see low liquidity.\n\nStake-based participation: Participation in the two programs above (discounted fees and incentives) for a given pool requires traders to stake a minimum number of tokens in the pool in advance and for the duration of the epoch. These stakes earn no explicit rewards. Any trader that does not stake this minimum number both will pay the standard fee to trade in that DeepBook pool and will be ineligible for maker incentives emanating from the pool. This upfront capital requirement further positions DeepBook as a hub for wholesale rather than retail liquidity.\n\nStake-based governance: Separately, stakers in a given pool control governance for that pool. Specifically, parameters around fees and maker incentives for a given pool will be controlled by stakers in that pool, with governance rights that increase with stake weights.\n\nProtecting users\n\nMany DeFi protocols are designed such that they inadvertently incentivize two self-serving behaviors from liquidity providers, wash trading and governance capture. Wash trading involves creating artificial volume to take advantage of volume discounts, while governance capture may let traders set rules favorable to themselves, at the expense of other users. The new token includes key protections in anticipation of these exploits.\n\nAs protection against wash trading, tokens collected in an epoch by a given pool can never be less than tokens distributed in that epoch by that same pool, with the delta being burned. In addition, total incentives decrease sharply in the amount of total activity, blunting a trader's economic incentive to send artificial volume.\n\nDeepBook mitigates governance capture by limiting rules setting to simple parameters. For example, while traders can vote for cheaper fees, that vote would apply to all fee schedules, eliminating the potential for targeted fee schedules that only benefit certain users. Further checking governance capture, governance rights do not increase at a linear rate in relation to stake quantity, with staking amounts delivering decreased rights above certain thresholds. This mechanism maintains a voice for smaller traders in the system.\n\nFull details of the DEEP token, including its allocation and flows, can be found in the DeepBook Token whitepaper.\n\nDEEP FAQ\nWas the airdrop delivered to the wallet or is it on a claim site?\nA DeepBook token claim is represented by an NFT sent to a qualified user’s wallet address. Recipients will be able to unwrap the NFT and obtain DEEP tokens when the DEEP token officially launches.\nHow can we tell if the DBClaimNFT we received is real?\nThe DeepBook website and twitter account will have the address that represents the DBClaimNFT collection. \nCan I transfer or sell the DBClaimNFT?\nThe DBClaimNFT is a soulbound NFT, meaning it cannot be sent to another wallet address or traded. The DBClaimNFT is permanently attached to the wallet address it was sent to.\nMy NFT is on a wallet I can’t access, what can I do?\nUnfortunately, if you have lost the private keys for the wallet which contains your DBClaimNFT you will not be able to claim your DB tokens when they are live.\nWhen can I use my DBClaimNFT to claim tokens?\nIn the future, once the DEEP token officially launches, users will be able to send a transaction to unwrap their DBClaimNFT and obtain liquid DEEP tokens.\nWhy did you decide to create a token? What is the purpose?\nThe DeepBook token was created to support the aim of the DeepBook platform becoming the premier decentralized central limit order book (CLOB) for wholesale liquidity on the Sui platform. The token enables DeepBook to better provide a reliable and inexpensive layer of liquidity for protocols and professional participants on Sui to access, while also allowing that layer to be decentralized. This makes DeepBook a valuable public good to the community, providing key financial infrastructure that is inexpensive for users, benefits ecosystem-wide liquidity, and supports the rich consumer-facing DeFi platform.\nWhat features does the token have? What is the utility?\nThere are four key flows for the DeepBook token: volume-based taker fees, maker incentives, stake-based participation, and staked-based governance. Please see the DeepBook token whitepaper for more details on each.\nWhat is the distribution of the token?\nIs the token mintable?\nAll of the tokens will be minted at the Token Generation Event (TGE) and will not be mintable into the future.\nAre you able to transfer the claim to the NFT?\nNo, the claim NFT is soul-bound and tied to the address it was sent to.\n\nNote: This content is for general educational and informational purposes only and should not be construed or relied upon as an endorsement or recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any asset, investment or financial product and does not constitute financial, legal, or tax advice.\n\nREAD NEXT\nzkLogin Adds Multi-sig Recovery, Apple Credentials\nAn update to zkLogin further extends its capabilities, giving users new options and adding use cases.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAY 9, 2024\nFirst Digital Stablecoin Debuting on Sui\nFDUSD, a stablecoin previously only offered on Ethereum and BNB Chain, expands its horizons on Sui.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 11, 2024\nMysticeti Set to Supercharge Consensus on Sui\nA new design for blockchain consensus reduces latency below Sui's already record-breaking speeds.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 10, 2024\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

      "html": "Sui.io\nHome\nAbout\nContribute an Article\nDEFI\nDeepBook Demystified: Fueling DeFi Innovation in Sui\nSui Foundation\nApr 25, 2024\n5 min\n\nDeepBook offers advanced trading features and deep liquidity while also making optimal use of Sui's consensus mechanism to execute trades concurrently.\n\nDiscover the power of DeepBook! Offering open access to deep liquidity for all apps building on Sui. Advanced trading capabilities can be incorporated into any app. Explore DeepBook’s architecture and create a new chapter in the story of DeFi with Sui.\n\nDeepBook, an ecosystem-wide liquidity layer, plays a critical role in supporting Sui’s DeFi ecosystem by providing stable and efficient infrastructure for trading activities available to all builders. It serves as the foundation upon which DeFi apps can operate, providing greater access to assets and enabling efficient trading. With such a tool, DeFi builders can focus on developing unique features and incentives instead of troubleshooting problems with simple trading logic and bootstrapping independent liquidity pools. \n\nAs a sophisticated Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) system, DeepBook enhances the efficiency and liquidity of Sui's overall DeFi ecosystem, enabling traders to execute orders quickly and at fair prices while leveraging advanced trading capabilities. This functionality not only attracts more participants but also reduces slippage and enhances overall market stability. Paired with Sui’s high-performance consensus engine, DeepBook offers a trading experience rivaling those of centralized trading entities. \n\nUnderstanding CLOBs and AMMs\n\nCentral Limit Order Books (CLOBs) and Automated Market Makers (AMMs) represent two distinct approaches to decentralized trading. CLOBs, like DeepBook, facilitate order matching by maintaining an order book of buy and sell orders. In contrast, AMMs utilize algorithms to determine asset prices and execute trades. While both CLOBs and AMMs offer unique advantages and cater to different trading preferences, CLOBs are particularly well-suited for traders seeking price discovery and order book transparency, making them an important tool for DeFi ecosystems.\n\nCreating a CLOB presents significant challenges due to the complexity of order matching algorithms and the need for efficient market liquidity. Developing and maintaining a CLOB requires sophisticated technical expertise and substantial resources, which can be prohibitive for many DeFi builders. However, offering an open-access CLOB accessible to all builders can have a transformative impact on the ecosystem. \n\nDeepBook democratizes access to advanced trading functionalities, such as limit orders, allowing developers to create unique trading platforms tailored to specific market needs. For example, by integrating a native CLOB into their protocol, builders can experiment with hybrid models that combine unique elements of AMMs with the powerful features of a CLOB. This opens up possibilities for innovative trading experiences that cater to diverse user preferences and trading strategies.\n\nDeciphering DeepBook's architecture\n\nAt the core of DeepBook lies its unique structure, where each trading pair has its own shared object representing the pool. DeepBook's approach utilizes Sui's consensus engine optimally by dedicating separate pools to each pair. This design minimizes conflicts between pairs and allows for parallelized transactions, enhancing efficiency. By leveraging Sui's consensus engine in this manner, DeepBook achieves remarkable throughput while ensuring seamless trading across various pairs.\n\nDeepBook serves as a valuable resource for app developers seeking access to deep liquidity. Leveraging the DeepBook API, apps can provide sophisticated trading functionalities, enabling users to execute trades using its smart routing feature to ensure competitive swap prices.\n\nUsers place trades through app interfaces which are integrated with DeepBook. Trades involving separate pools are processed concurrently, even if initiated by the same user via the same app.\n\nSui’s next-generation consensus mechanism, Mysticeti, will enable transaction speed rivaling those of centralized execution environments. With Mysticeti’s lightning-fast transaction processing capabilities and DeepBook’s advanced trading infrastructure, users can expect seamless and efficient trading experiences equivalent to those of traditional financial infrastructure. As Mysticeti and DeepBook continue to evolve in tandem, they empower Sui DeFi builders to build products not feasible on other blockchain platforms.   \n\nOrder book structure\n\nDeepBook employs a streamlined method for storing and processing orders. Each pool stores the unfilled maker orders and matches taker orders which are paired immediately upon submission. Order matching within DeepBook occurs autonomously, eliminating the need for centralized oversight.\n\nDeepBook gives apps the ability to offer their users  the flexibility to place market orders and various types of limit orders. Market orders, which are considered taker orders, are matched instantly against existing maker orders upon submission, all within the same transaction. Limit orders, on the other hand, are initially matched as taker orders against existing maker orders. If the limit order cannot be completely filled, the remaining quantity can either be added to the order book as a maker order or discarded, depending on the limit order's configuration.\n\nDeepBook utilizes a smart routing functionality, enabling traders to find the most efficient paths for token swap routes. Leveraging Depth-First-Search (DFS) algorithms, traders can simulate swaps across different pools to optimize their trades. This strategic approach ensures that swaps are cost-effective and enhances overall trading efficiency on the platform.\n\nDEEP token \n\nDeepBook’s upcoming token, DEEP, will further improve the economic dynamics of DeepBook. Those serious about trading on Sui will be able to stake DEEP in order to receive discounted trading fees, additional maker incentives, and the ability to participate in DeepBook pool governance. \n\nThose that stake DEEP to a specific pool and actively swap within that pool over an epoch will pay less taker fees than those that are occasionally participating in swapping. Within an epoch, a user who has the threshold of staked DEEP will experience a decline in taker fees with respect to their volume taken in that pool over the epoch. Additionally, those who also meet the staked DEEP requirements and are providing liquidity to the pool they have staked to will receive maker incentives. Governance of pools allow for the adjustment of parameters around fees and staking requirements. There are no minimum stake requirements to participate in governance and governance rights increase with stake weights.\n\nWhile the DEEP token is not currently available, unique soulbound NFTs have been distributed ahead of the upcoming token launch.\n\nDetering wash trading\n\nTo deter manipulative practices, DeepBook adopts a carefully balanced approach to incentivizing liquidity provision. While incentives are offered to active liquidity providers, there's a risk of traders creating artificial volume to earn more rewards. To counter this exploit, DeepBook intentionally sets maker incentives lower than the fees collected on trades once a pool reaches a minimal liquidity threshold. This ensures that incentives are proportionate to genuine trading activity, discouraging manipulative behavior.\n\nAs an additional safeguard, DeepBook implements a burning mechanism for tokens involved in wash trading. If someone tries to inflate trading volumes within an epoch by repeatedly looping tokens through the pool without any net change, these tokens are labeled as residual tokens. To uphold platform integrity, these residual tokens are removed from circulation through burning. This ensures that rewards are earned through genuine trading activity and not deceptive practices like wash trading, maintaining the platform's integrity.\n\nTo learn more about the economic incentives and dynamics around DeepBook and the DEEP token, explore the DeepBook token whitepaper.\n\nTurning the page with DeepBook\n\nDeepBook democratizes access to advanced trading functionalities, empowering developers to create unique trading platforms and providing users with experiences rivaling those of centralized trading platforms. Through carefully balanced incentives and innovative mechanisms to deter manipulative practices like wash trading, DeepBook maintains platform integrity and ensures rewards are earned only through genuine trading activity. \n\nNumerous DeFi apps on Sui are integrating DeepBook into their product suites. Among the most prominent are Aftermath, Cetus, KriyaDEX, Turbos, and Typus. If you're eager to witness DeepBook's capabilities in action, these DeFi platforms serve as excellent showcases of its utilization. Explore their docs to see how they’re integrated DeepBook into their offerings.\n\nAs DeepBook continues to evolve and with the upcoming launch of the DEEP token, it stands to further revolutionize decentralized trading and empower DeFi participants within the Sui community.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: This content is for general educational and informational purposes only and should not be construed or relied upon as an endorsement or recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any asset, investment or financial product and does not constitute financial, legal, or tax advice.\n\nREAD NEXT\nFirst Digital Stablecoin Debuting on Sui\nFDUSD, a stablecoin previously only offered on Ethereum and BNB Chain, expands its horizons on Sui.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 11, 2024\nDeepBook Previews Token Launch with NFT Airdrop\nDeepBook NFT recipients will be able to claim the DEEP token when it launches.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 2, 2024\nSolend Team Launches New DeFi Protocol Suilend\nThe team behind the most popular lending protocol on Solana brings its expertise to Sui.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 11, 2024\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

      "html": "Sui.io\nHome\nAbout\nContribute an Article\nMOVE\nAll About Kiosks\nSui Foundation\nAug 23, 2023\n2 min\n\nThe Kiosk primitive on Sui lets builders quickly set up shops and sell digital assets, enforcing policies such as royalties that automatically collect fees for content creators.\n\nAs a primitive on Sui, Kiosks natively let people set up shops to display and sell NFTs and other digital assets. Kiosks serve the creative community by letting sellers set automatically enforced royalties that extend to third-party transfers of their work.\n\nAlthough systems supporting commerce are common on the traditional Web, the technology itself wasn't specifically designed for this usage. Sui's commerce support, which includes trusted transactions and data privacy, is built in as a fundamental feature of the network.\n\nSmart contracts written in Move and Sui's inherent security serve as fundamental pillars supporting commerce. The Kiosk primitive takes commerce a step further, supporting features such as auctions, custom transaction policies including royalties, and secure ownership transference.\n\nShops for all\n\nWith the Kiosk primitive, everyone from individuals to large markets have all the tools they need, built natively into Sui, to set up shop. Builders don't need to develop additional layers or employ third party services, as they do on the traditional Web and some other blockchains.\n\nIn Sui programming terms, a Kiosk is a shared object on the network that stores digital assets. The Kiosk creator administers it through KioskOwnerCap, a single-owner object. Digital assets stored by a Kiosk, which are technically objects owned by the Kiosk object, can be sold, auctioned, or given away.\n\nBecause Kiosk is a primitive on Sui, setting one up requires relatively simple code, as shown below.\n\nimport { createKioskAndShare } from '@myshop/kiosk';\n\nlet tx = new TransactionBuilder();\nlet kioskOwnerCap = createKioskAndShare(tx);\n\ntx.transferObjects([ kioskOwnerCap ], tx.pure(sender, 'address'));\n\nThe process for putting assets up for sale in the Kiosk first requires transferring them to the Kiosk using the sui::kiosk::place function, then listing them using the kiosk::list function. These functions are all built into Sui. Potential buyers can browse listed objects and purchase them.\n\nBeyond simply transferring ownership of digital assets, however, Kiosk lets creators set policies about the asset type. A common use case involves setting royalties on original artwork, usually an NFT. Royalties mean the creator can retain an economic interest in the NFT even as it is transferred from one party to another. For example, the creator could set a three percent royalty, earning them three percent of the amount of any subsequent sales. Royalties ensure that artists whose work becomes very popular in subsequent trades continue to profit from their work, and are incentivized to create more.\n\nE-Commerce revolution\n\nTotal e-commerce sales hit $5.7 trillion last year, but building this market required a huge investment in engineering resources going back to the Amazon and eBay launches in 1995. Services such as Shopify and Square continued big build-outs to extend e-commerce to more players.\n\nSui, however, thoughtfully builds in e-commerce capabilities as a fundamental feature. Sui gives individuals and companies the tools to set up all manner of markets with only a fraction of the investment made by e-commerce titans on the traditional Web.\n\nSui's Kiosk supports many use cases, from the aforementioned NFT markets to digital music services, where recording artists can set and earn their own royalties. Photographers and movie makers can look to Sui as an entirely new distribution model. Digital assets can also represent real property, such as a car title or property deed. Sui's features give it the potential to revolutionize e-commerce.\n\nREAD NEXT\nThe Top 3 Mobile Wallets on Sui\nMobile wallets are crucial to increasing adoption and accessibility.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAY 15, 2024\n5 Games Coming to Sui: A Glimpse into the Future of Gaming\nNew gaming experiences are created on Sui and numerous games are launching this year!\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 22, 2024\nSui funds University Researchers from KAIST, UCL, National University of Singapore\nSui Academic Research Awards provides funding to 17 researchers pushing the boundaries of blockchain-related technologies.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 14, 2024\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

      "html": "Sui.io\nHome\nAbout\nContribute an Article\nSUI ECOSYSTEM\nAll About Smart Contracts\nSui Foundation\nAug 30, 2023\n2 min\n\nIn their simplest form, smart contracts govern transactions, but the Sui Move programming language opens the possibility for much more sophisticated apps.\n\nCoding for blockchain and other computing environments shares many similarities, but much of the focus on blockchain is devoted to building smart contracts. Deployed as compiled code, Smart contracts are essentially apps that automatically execute transactions on the blockchain. The Sui virtual machine, native to the Sui network, processes smart contracts written in the Move programming language.\n\nThe term, \"smart contract,\" implies the unique transaction-focused environment of blockchain networks. And given the permissionless, public environment of the blockchain, smart contracts need to enforce rules to govern transactions, building a certain amount of trust into the system.\n\nMove gives smart contracts on Sui an edge over other networks in that it builds in security and makes objects, such as NFTs or any other digital asset, a first class concept. Elevating objects in this manner means developers don't need to manage data at the byte-code level.\n\nManipulating objects\n\nSimilar to an enterprise microservices architecture, the blockchain hosts many smart contracts that execute an action based on particular events. To some extent, the work being done by microservices can be equated to transactions, but a microservices architecture is a trusted environment. On a blockchain, more care needs to be taken in every transaction's approval, including verifying the addresses of the parties engaged in the transaction.\n\nOne of the simplest smart contracts enacts a trade of digital assets between two parties. When both parties agree to the terms of the smart contract, it transfers ownership of the traded digital assets between the parties, and records the new ownership on the blockchain. This model ensures that neither party can withhold the asset they agreed to trade, as the smart contract enforces the ownership transfer.\n\nTrading tokens and NFTs, a common current usage of smart contracts, is a niche activity. However, the use cases open up considerably when taking into account how much of ownership has become digitized in some manner. When someone buys a house, they typically don't show up with a suitcase full of cash and receive the house in return. A bank accounts for the money to pay for the house digitally, and a deed confirms ownership of the house. Although many jurisdictions require a paper version of the deed, there's little reason not to make deeds digital.\n\nIf all physical items bought through e-commerce could be represented with a digital title, and processed using a smart contract, online services such as eBay would be much more trustworthy.\n\nBeyond the simple transaction model, smart contracts on Sui can be much more complex. Sui offers composability in its object programming, meaning objects can own other objects, allowing for intricate data structures. A set of objects can represent an environment in a game, for example, where some objects may be trees that can be turned into firewood, without affecting the land object underneath them. A player in this type of scenario may trigger a smart contract that lets them cut down the trees and transform them into firewood.\n\nSmarter programming\n\nA smart contract is only as good as its native programming language. The Move language was designed to make smart contract programming easier than other blockchain languages. Move is considered a high-level language, somewhat similar to Javascript, in that it requires less data management. Where general purpose languages such as Rust do not target a specific audience or task, Move on Sui provides a more focused set of primitives designed specifically with safe smart contract programmers in mind.\n\nDevelopers new to Web3 will need to embrace the concept of smart contracts, but Move will give them the capabilities they expect.\n\nREAD NEXT\nThe Top 3 Mobile Wallets on Sui\nMobile wallets are crucial to increasing adoption and accessibility.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAY 15, 2024\n5 Games Coming to Sui: A Glimpse into the Future of Gaming\nNew gaming experiences are created on Sui and numerous games are launching this year!\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 22, 2024\nSui funds University Researchers from KAIST, UCL, National University of Singapore\nSui Academic Research Awards provides funding to 17 researchers pushing the boundaries of blockchain-related technologies.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 14, 2024\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

With the launch of Mainnet and its SUI token last May, the Sui network hosts a growing number of DeFi protocols, giving users many options to engage in DeFi.\n\nDeFi services on Sui benefit from the network’s unique transaction processing model, which enables higher throughput than other blockchains, allowing for more DeFi activity per second. Sui also finalizes transactions more quickly than other chains, so DeFi users are less likely to be penalized by delays in concluding trades, an important feature in volatile markets. Sui's low, predictable gas fees, in comparison to other chains, mean each DeFi transaction costs less.\n\nThe more than 20 DeFi protocols currently available on Sui include decentralized exchanges (DEXes) and lending services, many of which are listed on DeFi Llama. Traditionally, DEXes let users trade tokens. Lending services, on the other hand, make it easy for users to lend or borrow tokens at specific interest rates set during the transaction. Amongst these basic activities, each DeFi protocol offers specific and sometimes unique features to help users.\n\nLiquidity pools\n\nSUI, the native token on the Sui network, has several uses but is particularly important for facilitating and executing transactions on chain. The larger blockchain industry includes many more token types, including transactional, governance, utility, security, and platform. For example, a game hosted on Sui might use its own token, something players can earn through in-game activities and trade for items to customize their characters. \n\nSome tokens serve purely financial purposes, such as stablecoins, which are tied to the value of a particular fiat currency. To add to the variety of tokens DeFi users can find on Sui, bridging lets people import tokens from other networks. Tokens originating from other blockchains will generally have bridge-specific wrappers, a bit of code describing the token's origins and attributes, so they can exist on Sui. \n\nBlockchain users go to DEXes to trade one type of token for another, often called a swap, and pay a transaction fee for each trade. DEXes maintain the token supply needed to mediate those trades in liquidity pools. DeFi users who contribute tokens to liquidity pools earn rewards based on the transaction fees paid by token traders and additional pool incentives. The typical liquidity pool model requires an equivalent value of each token to be maintained in the pool, and users may contribute tokens in equivalent value to provide liquidity and earn rewards. For example, if someone wanted to trade USDC for SUI, the DEX would draw the SUI for the trade from its SUI/USDC liquidity pool, deposit the USDC into the pool, and adjust the price of assets algorithmically. \n\nTurbos Finance hosts many liquidity pools. For its SUI/USDC pool, DeFi users contribute both SUI and USDC and earn rewards at an annual percentage rate of 221.30, which fluctuates depending on the pool's incentives, volume, and total locked value.\n\nDEXes on Sui typically offer many more options besides contributing to liquidity pools. DEXes may offer services including staking, borrowing, and lending. However, maintaining liquidity pools for token trades has historically been a core service.\n\nBorrowing and lending\n\nThe decentralized nature of Sui means lenders don't have to be big institutions; anyone can engage in lending tokens on Sui. However, much of the lending and borrowing is mediated through DeFi services. These services develop and deploy smart contracts governing the lending and borrowing, ensuring the desired terms are met. \n\nLenders can expect interest from borrowers in the form of tokens, the classic incentive to offer a loan. Unlike traditional lending, however, smart contracts minimize the risk of the lender not being repaid. The smart contract that governs the loan automatically repays the loan and interest from the borrower's wallet based on the agreed upon terms.\n\nMany lending protocols require that borrowers be over-collateralized, meaning users must lend assets to the protocol before they can borrow from it. Along with liquidation mechanisms, overcollateralization ensures a financially healthy protocol with permissionless access. Borrowers can use the loaned tokens to engage in other DeFi activities, such as staking or contributing to liquidity pools, which may earn greater rewards than the loan's interest rate. \n\nScallop lets anyone with tokens put them up to be loaned out, with the promise of specific interest rates on the amount they loan.\nCaveat emptor\n\nAnyone wanting to engage in DeFi needs to research the services they want to use carefully. Understand the terms and fees to make sure the service meets all expectations. Another important thing to note is that different countries have different regulations when it comes to DeFi activities. Although many blockchain exchanges won't offer services to people in countries where it is forbidden, some may not be so careful. It's important for DeFi users to know their own country's regulations when it comes to DeFi.\n\nREAD NEXT\nAt Over $500 Million TVL, Sui Lands in the DeFi Top 10\nSui's growth in DeFi metrics has been rapid, hitting half a billion dollars in total value locked in less than a year.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nFEB 4, 2024\nAll About Bridging\nSui supports transferring tokens and NFTs to and from other blockchains through Wormhole Connect and other services.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nSEP 6, 2023\nThe Economics of DeepBook\nDeepBook incentives robust trading activity through Sui's low, predictable gas fees.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAUG 17, 2023\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

This process gets around the issue of locking up tokens with Validators that occurs with traditional staking. Users can secure the network through Sui's proof-of-stake mechanism without forgoing participation in the ecosystem.\n\nWhen Sui Mainnet launched on May 4, 2023, SUI staked to a Validator was locked and could not be used for any other purpose. A few months later, community members filed a Sui Improvement Proposal to allow liquid staking on Sui.\n\nA subsequent hackathon resulted in multiple liquid staking protocols, creating options for users who want to gain rewards through staking while also using their tokens for DeFi.\n\nLiquid staking tokens\n\nLiquid staking protocols issue their own custom tokens in exchange for staked SUI. Owners of these liquid staking tokens (LSTs) can put them into liquidity pools or engage in other DeFi activities. The owner not only gains staking rewards, they also earn any rewards offered by other DeFi activities.\n\nFor example, a user may stake 1,000 SUI through a liquid staking protocol. That protocol issues 1,000 of its own LST in return. The owner can then contribute their 1,000 LST to any liquidity pools that support it.\n\nAftermath Finance, a decentralized exchange (DEX) which won first place in the hackathon, offers its LST, afSUI, in exchange for users that stake through its protocol. Users can then take that afSUI and put it into liquidity pools, swap for other tokens, and lend it out.\n\nSecond and third place in the hackathon were won by Haedal and Volo, respectively. The Haedal protocol issues haSUI as its LST, while Volo offers voloSUI. \n\nhaSUI, Haedal's LST, trades at a changeable rate with SUI, similar to other cryptocurrencies. \n\nLiquid staking protocols support their own LSTs for DeFi, of course, but other DEXes may support them as well. LSTs with the greatest volume on Sui will likely be the most desirable, with more opportunities for use. \n\nSwapping LSTs for other tokens on a DEX also trades away the staked SUI associated with that LST. In that sense, LSTs may become very desirable, as they represent their own utility and the equivalent amount of SUI. Unstaking SUI becomes more complex with LSTs, as the DEX that issued the LST will have a specific method for exchanging the original stake for the LSTs given in exchange.\n\nLeveraging LSTs\n\nLiquid staking offers DeFi users on Sui a means of increasing their rewards through leveraging staked assets. DEXes may not have liquidity pools or swap opportunities for all LSTs. Users will need to carefully assess the different LSTs and protocols to find one best suited for their goals.\n\nREAD NEXT\nAt Over $500 Million TVL, Sui Lands in the DeFi Top 10\nSui's growth in DeFi metrics has been rapid, hitting half a billion dollars in total value locked in less than a year.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nFEB 4, 2024\nAll About Bridging\nSui supports transferring tokens and NFTs to and from other blockchains through Wormhole Connect and other services.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nSEP 6, 2023\nThe Economics of DeepBook\nDeepBook incentives robust trading activity through Sui's low, predictable gas fees.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAUG 17, 2023\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

The decentralized exchanges (DEXes) and other DeFi services responsible for this activity benefited from the Sui community's work building a scalable network and creating a sustainable tokenomics model.\n\nDesigned to scale, Sui handles high traffic volume without a corresponding increase in gas fees. Its parallel transaction processing model achieves finality very quickly by distinguishing between single owner and shared objects. Both of these technical achievements serve DeFi users by giving them low-cost, quick transactions.\n\nThe Sui community's work in creating a fertile environment for DeFi in the first half of 2023 led to strong results for these protocols in the second half. Over 22 DeFi protocols operate on the network, ramping up TVL growth to the present number and delivering impressive volume numbers as well, hitting a combined $477 million for the month of November.\n\nFoundational work \n\nUsing a proof-of-stake tokenomics model, Sui requires its Validators to hold a stake of 30 million SUI, its native token, and rewards them for processing transactions. In the first quarter of 2023, well before Mainnet launch, Sui ran Testnet Wave 2 as a means of testing the tokenomics model. Through various stress tests and exercises in a globally distributed environment, the results proved the model used the right mix of economic incentives to secure Sui’s scalable and parallelizable architecture. As predicted, gas fees remained low as the network’s computing power grew horizontally in response to increased demand.\n\nSui's real debut happened on May 4 with Mainnet launch, taking the network beyond its testing phase and opening the gates for an eager community and the wider industry. Bootstrapping an entirely new layer 1 blockchain, getting the flywheel of its tokenomics model turning, is no easy task. Beyond foundational elements, it requires community collaboration. Sui's token emission schedule, announced on June 28, serves as one element of thoughtfully bringing the network to sustainability. Although the tokenomics model sets an upper limit of 10 billion SUI, the emission schedule meters this amount over time, neither flooding the system nor starving it. \n\nThe Sui community launched DeepBook, its first native liquidity layer, on July 12, jumpstarting the DeFi ecosystem with an essential tool supporting token swaps. As a central limit order book, DeepBook serves both market and limit orders, giving apps and users flexibility in deciding how they want to buy and sell tokens. DEXes can leverage DeepBook to quickly ramp up their operations.\n\nAs another boon for Sui DeFi, liquid staking kicked off last summer. Requested by the community through a Sui Improvement Proposal, liquid staking essentially lets people commit their staked SUI to liquid staking tokens (LSTs) they can then use for yield-earning DeFi activities, such as loans and swaps. A liquid staking hackathon, running from mid-August to late September, resulted in three winners: Aftermath Finance with afSUI, Haedal Protocol with haSUI, and Volo with voloSUI. \n\nDeFi growth\n\nSui's quick transaction processing and low, predictable gas fees led over 20 DeFi protocols to launch on the network in the last six months. These protocols, a combination of DEXes and lending platforms, offer a wide range of DeFi activities, giving users many options.\n\nAmidst these protocols, many boast high growth numbers on social media. Cetus, a consistent top performer, accumulated $1 billion in trading volume as of November 26. On November 27, FlowX Finance posted it had reached over 500,000 transactions and over $9 million TVL. And Bluefin reported 24-hour trading volume of $151.3 million on December 4. These represent just a few of the individual DeFi success stories on Sui.\n\nDefi users and protocols drove incredible DeFi growth on Sui, with metrics spiking in recent months. As of October 17, the network's TVL rose 341 percent, to $57.69 million, and volume rose 229 percent, according to DefiLlama. Sui hit a major milestone of over $100 million TVL on November 8. Then it crossed $150 million TVL on November 30. And then it went even higher, crossing $175 million TVL on December 6. \n\nBeyond TVL, other metrics showing DeFi growth on Sui include transaction volume. Although volume tends to rise and fall from day to day, monthly averages show continued growth. As a more specific metric showing DeFi strength on Sui, users bridged over $100 million of the USDC stablecoin to the network as of December 7. \n\nCreating opportunity\n\nBeyond supporting Sui's underlying tokenomics, DeFi activity offers the promise of democratizing the financial industry. Activities once confined to Wall Street not only become available on Main Street, but even to developing countries around the world. This potential for economic opportunity opens up participation beyond the heavily capitalized. \n\nThe success of DeFi protocols on Sui in 2023 shows the network can be a supportive environment for global activity. And we look forward to seeing what 2024 will bring.\n\nREAD NEXT\nAt Over $500 Million TVL, Sui Lands in the DeFi Top 10\nSui's growth in DeFi metrics has been rapid, hitting half a billion dollars in total value locked in less than a year.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nFEB 4, 2024\nAll About Bridging\nSui supports transferring tokens and NFTs to and from other blockchains through Wormhole Connect and other services.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nSEP 6, 2023\nThe Economics of DeepBook\nDeepBook incentives robust trading activity through Sui's low, predictable gas fees.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAUG 17, 2023\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

Reaching this amount in less than a year mirrors other breakthrough metrics on Sui, such as its peak transactions-per-second (TPS) approaching 6,000. \n\nBreaking through $500 million TVL puts Sui in the top 10 of all blockchains.\n\nSui edged over $500 million in TVL, as reported by DeFiLlama.\n\nTVL represents the amount users have added to DeFi protocols, which include lending, borrowing, and taking positions in derivatives. The rise in TVL shows a high interest in Sui's DeFi protocols as users explore the many options available. \n\nTwo factors unique to Sui, time to finality and low transaction fees, help DeFi protocols grow their user numbers. Sui's consensus mechanism allows subsecond finality, so transactions complete quickly, letting users react in real-time to market conditions. Consistently low transaction fees, which do not rise as traffic increases, give users confidence their tokens will remain productive rather than being absorbed as network costs.\n\nBeyond those fundamental features, DeFi protocols on Sui benefit from user-friendly features such as sponsored transactions and zkLogin, greeting easing the onboarding experience.\n\nAlthough TVL is useful in representing overall DeFi activity, volume is an equally important metric. Unlike TVL, volume tends to be volatile from day to day. Looking at a 30-day average, however, shows a trendline on a significantly ascent. Sui's average daily volume over January, 2024, rose to $47.2 million. Given Sui's scalability, volume drives fees for DeFi protocols, contributing to their success.\n\nDeFi protocols on Sui logged rapidly increasing volume recently, as measured in 30-day averages, rising to $47.2 million.\n\nSui's rapid growth indicates its exceptional market fit, offering Web3 developers expressiveness and flexibility unique in the industry. The experiences they create attract both crypto-native and inexperienced users, the latter who may have never before used a Web3 app. \n\nUltimately, Sui's growth and promise comes down to the community's hard work in developing the network and leveraging its features and attributes to create leading DeFi protocols.\n\nREAD NEXT\nFirst Digital Stablecoin Debuting on Sui\nFDUSD, a stablecoin previously only offered on Ethereum and BNB Chain, expands its horizons on Sui.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 11, 2024\nDeepBook Previews Token Launch with NFT Airdrop\nDeepBook NFT recipients will be able to claim the DEEP token when it launches.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 2, 2024\nSolend Team Launches New DeFi Protocol Suilend\nThe team behind the most popular lending protocol on Solana brings its expertise to Sui.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 11, 2024\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

      "html": "Sui.io\nHome\nAbout\nContribute an Article\nINFRASTRUCTURE\nAll About Directed Acyclic Graphs\nSui Foundation\nApr 4, 2024\n4 min\n\nSui utilizes a DAG in it's network architecture offering greater efficiency and performance for applications downstream.\n\nSui's record-breaking transactions-per-second performance comes partially due to a mathematical construct, the directed acyclic graph (DAG). This construct speeds up network transactions by processing them in the most efficient manner, rather than a first-come, first served linear progression.\n\nCombining the non-linear nature of a DAG with a blockchain, a distributed ledger designed to ensure data integrity, entwines the virtues of two technologies. As a blockchain network, Sui preserves historicity and custody of data objects, while its DAG-based consensus system makes manipulation of those data objects nimble.\n\nWhat is a DAG?\n\nA DAG is a type of data structure differing from the linear chain structure of traditional blockchains. Unlike blockchains, which consist of blocks linked together in a linear fashion, DAGs are more like a web of interconnected nodes. To understand DAGs, let's first break down the acronym in reverse order. \n\nIn the context of distributed ledger technology, a graph database organizes data using interconnected structures akin to a web of relationships. The relationships between each individual data entry, or transaction, with others is used to form a network of information based on causal relationships. Through this approach, complex transactional relationships and dependencies are captured in the network.\n\nAdding acyclic to the definition means there is no way to create a loop or cycle within the ledger or database. In other words, it is impossible to create a path within the database that leads to a situation where an earlier transaction relies on a later transaction. This property ensures that information flows in a one-way direction, bringing us to the final part of the acronym, directed. Being a directed graph, each relationship has a defined direction indicating the flow of information within the database. The directed nature allows for clear and unambiguous data flow, crucial for maintaining integrity and facilitating efficient processing of transactions.\n\nTransactions within a DAG have explicit relationships with others that create a web-like structure. Note that eventually each transaction is observed by all nodes and, for simplicity, this image is showing that a transaction is only observed by a single node.\n\nIn summary, a DAG is a database structured as a network of interconnected pieces of information, or transactions, that are linked together based on their dependencies forming a graph that expands with each new transaction.\n\nBlockchains and DAGs\n\nBlockchains typically batch a group of transactions into a block which then go through a consensus process as a single entity. Blocks are linked together in a linear fashion which requires that the network’s state changes in a stepwise manner, block by block. On the other hand, transactions within a DAG are able to achieve consensus independently, bypassing the process of grouping many transactions into a block for the consensus process. \n\nIn a blockchain, all the network validators have an agreed upon network state that they all work from. Validators assess a single group of transactions at the same time and cannot progress until a supermajority has come to an agreement on the validity of the block. For a block to be considered valid and be cemented into the blockchain, all of the transactions within that block must be valid. If a single transaction within the block is not valid, the entire block is discarded and must be recreated without the invalid transaction. Achieving consensus in a blockchain requires the validators to operate in lockstep, approving transactions block by block.\n\nSimilar to how consensus is achieved in a blockchain, transactions within a DAG achieve consensus once signed-off by a supermajority of the network validators. A key difference lies in the fact that each validator within a DAG has a different subset of the network state. In other words, the entire network state is not stored in each validator but instead can only be observed by cumulating individual validators' understanding of the network. \n\nThere is no block of transactions that is validated at once by all validators, instead individual transactions are propagated throughout the network gaining signatures from individual validators that have knowledge of the network state needed to validate the transaction. Once the transaction obtains signatures from a supermajority of the network validators, it has achieved consensus and is considered finalized.\n\nAs a result of this structure, utilizing a DAG for transaction propagation and consensus allows for transactions to be confirmed asynchronously and concurrently, offering a more flexible and scalable approach compared to blockchains.\n\nFrom DAG to Sui blockchain\n\nSui utilizes a DAG for transaction propagation and consensus and then, in a separate process, orders transactions into checkpoints, which are similar to blocks. Checkpoints are linked together and ordered in a linear fashion, similar to the structure of a typical blockchain. The main difference about Sui's blockchain structure is that transactions grouped into checkpoints are already finalized, in contrast to typical blockchains structures which group transactions not yet finalized into blocks. \n\nThe main difference about Sui's blockchain structure is that transactions grouped into checkpoints are already finalized, in contrast to typical blockchains structures which group transactions not yet finalized into blocks.\nLinking it all together\n\nSui's innovative approach combines the best features of both DAGs and blockchains, creating a network that offers unparalleled speed and flexibility. By utilizing a DAG for transaction propagation and consensus, Sui ensures that transactions can be confirmed asynchronously and concurrently, allowing for a more scalable and efficient system compared to traditional blockchains. However, to maintain the integrity and order of historical information, Sui employs a separate process to organize transactions into checkpoints, akin to blocks in a blockchain.  \n\nThese checkpoints are then linked together and ordered in a linear fashion, providing a familiar structure for storing and accessing historical data. Unlike traditional blockchains where transactions are grouped into blocks before consensus, in Sui transactions included in checkpoints are already finalized, offering a streamlined and efficient approach to transaction validation and storage. \n\nThis hybrid architecture allows Sui to harness the benefits of both DAGs and blockchains, creating a robust and adaptable platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts.\n\n\n\n\nNote: This content is for general educational and informational purposes only and should not be construed or relied upon as an endorsement or recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any asset, investment or financial product and does not constitute financial, legal, or tax advice.\n\nREAD NEXT\nThe Top 3 Mobile Wallets on Sui\nMobile wallets are crucial to increasing adoption and accessibility.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAY 15, 2024\nMysticeti Set to Supercharge Consensus on Sui\nA new design for blockchain consensus reduces latency below Sui's already record-breaking speeds.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 10, 2024\nTencent Blockchain RPC Service Now Supports Sui\nSui developers will find a variety of plans supporting apps of all sizes.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 28, 2024\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

Sui is today a low-latency leader due to its fast path, but the new consensus protocol extends lower latencies for all transactions.\n\nSui's design combines the Narwhal-Bullshark consensus algorithm with a fast path, and makes a distinction between processing involving owned objects and shared objects. It processes the former on a fast path and the latter on a consensus path in committing to the blockchain. Under this mechanism, Sui set a record in 2023 of 5,414 TPS and 65 million transactions in a single day.  \n\nContinued research resulted in Mysticeti, which improves on Narwhal-Bullshark by addressing specific latency issues inherent in the system. Test results showed 500 milliseconds to commit for consensus and 250 milliseconds for single-owner transactions, while maintaining extremely high throughputs. Designed specifically for Sui, Mysticeti supports both single-owner object transactions, the fast path, and shared object transactions, at a fraction of the CPU costs and complexity of today’s Sui network.\n\nRedesigning consensus\n\nAs with Narwhal and Tusk, Mysticeti uses a consensus algorithm based on a direct acyclic graph (DAG), where each validator proposes blocks of transactions linking to past blocks. Narwhal-Tusk showed that a DAG-based consensus algorithm can decouple latency from throughput, and maintain extremely high throughput even in the presence of network and node failures. A primary-workers architecture allowed Narwhal-based designs to increase throughput arbitrability without limits. \n\nHowever, Narwhal-Tusk's latency of commits was slightly worse than with coupled designs, such as Jolteon and Ditto, the algorithm adopted by Meta’s Diem project, for three reasons: \n\nFirst, Narwhal certifies blocks individually, as they need to be signed by a quorum of validators, each round, before being shared with all. This process results in a latency of one and a half round trips for blocks during each round. As a commit takes two rounds in Bullshark, blocks need three round trips for a commit. Mysticeti validators instead just sign and share their blocks, achieving latency of a half round trip for each block during a round. This change results in a 50 percent reduction of round trips and is, to our knowledge, the lowest number of round-trips for any existing DAG-based consensus algorithm.\n\nSecond, Narwhal and Tusk's primary-worker distinction in each validator increased throughput but may also increase latency in some circumstances. A worker needs to ensure that a sufficient number of other workers receive a block before sharing its hash with the primary to include in a header. In worst case scenarios latency increases by another round trip. This worker-primary architecture allows consensus-scaling when network bandwidth on a single machine becomes a bottleneck, which tends to occur in the range of hundreds of thousands TPS. Mysticeti breaks away from this architecture and simply inlines transactions within the primary’s block, which still allows for very high throughput in the range of over 100,000 TPS.\n\nFinally, Bullshark and Tusk, as specified in the original paper, commit only every two or approximately three rounds, respectively, and they only commit the sub-DAG linked by the leader block. Due to this cycle, an unlucky transaction that was included just after a committed block may wait twice the number of rounds before being committed, or even more if it is not linked by the next leader. Mysticeti’s novel commit rule naturally appoints multiple leaders every round, allowing for more transactions to be committed earlier. This innovation gives Mysticeti the greatest boost in reducing latency.\n\nAs a result of these changes, Mysticeti achieves commits within three message delays, which translates to about 500 milliseconds in a testing environment on a wide area network (WAN). It still maintains a solid throughput of over 50,000 TPS under low latency, and over 100,000 TPS for a latency of around 1 second. It maintains other benefits of DAG consensus, including robustness against failures, censorship resistance, chain quality, high throughput, and full usage of network resources across validators. Full performance results are included in the paper, Mysticeti: Low-Latency DAG Consensus with Fast Commit Path. Source code for Mysticeti's evaluation can be found on GitHub. \n\nMoreover, Sui's fast path for owned object transactions achieves finality after two round trips in an ideal scenario, around 250 milliseconds on a WAN. To maintain this very fast mode, Mysticeti also includes a fast path. A validator can include a transaction for which other validators then vote through the Mysticeti DAG without additional signatures. Mysticeti inlines transactions within blocks, enabling this process. As a result, a transaction can be certified without a mass of signature generation and verification, allowing five to 10 times faster path transactions to be processed by the same CPU. \n\nSetting a new standard\n\nLatency of 500 milliseconds to commit is the fastest ever reported at high throughputs for large-scale WAN consensus, and has the potential to revolutionize the blockchain industry. Couple that with scalable infrastructure reaching 50,000 TPS, and Sui becomes a compelling competitor to centralized computing systems in terms of raw performance.\n\nREAD NEXT\nThe Top 3 Mobile Wallets on Sui\nMobile wallets are crucial to increasing adoption and accessibility.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAY 15, 2024\nzkLogin Adds Multi-sig Recovery, Apple Credentials\nAn update to zkLogin further extends its capabilities, giving users new options and adding use cases.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAY 9, 2024\nFirst Digital Stablecoin Debuting on Sui\nFDUSD, a stablecoin previously only offered on Ethereum and BNB Chain, expands its horizons on Sui.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 11, 2024\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

      "html": "Sui.io\nHome\nAbout\nContribute an Article\nINFRASTRUCTURE\nAll About DePIN\nSui Foundation\nMay 2, 2024\n4 min\n\nDecentralized physical infrastructure networks will revolutionize how we interact with the world around us.\n\nThe concept of Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) offers the potential to redefine the fundamental processes of our everyday lives. Technology often evolves towards more efficient and secure solutions, and the development of physical infrastructure is no different.\n\nDecentralization has been a prevailing theme across various industries, challenging established norms and reshaping traditional structures. In finance, the rise of DeFi has revolutionized how we engage with financial systems. Utilizing blockchain technology, DeFi breaks down barriers to entry and allows for more one-on-one interactions, reducing the role of the middleman, and granting individuals greater autonomy.\n\nWhile industries built on software evolve more easily, physical infrastructure changes more slowly, yet decentralization offers compelling advantages. Historically marked by centralized authority and rigid hierarchies, this sector is ready for transformation. DePIN's goal involves leveraging blockchain technology to democratize ownership and distribute control of the physical infrastructure networks that we collectively use on a day-to-day basis.\n\nThe DePIN vision\n\nTo fully grasp the significance of DePIN, it's essential to contrast it with conventional physical infrastructure networks. In traditional models, centralized authorities typically control infrastructure, resulting in inefficiencies in processes and disparities in incentives. Centralized control often leads to bureaucratic bottlenecks, where decision-making is concentrated in the hands of a select few, slowing responsiveness to evolving needs. This centralized structure can perpetuate inequalities, as resources and benefits are distributed unevenly, leaving certain communities underserved.\n\nIn contrast, DePIN represents a shift towards decentralization, placing power and agency in the hands of a diverse network of participants. By embracing decentralization, DePIN empowers individuals, communities, and businesses to collectively own and govern the infrastructure they depend on. This distributed model fosters a sense of ownership and accountability among stakeholders, leading to greater efficiency and resilience. Additionally, decentralization promotes innovation and adaptability, as it disperses decision-making, allowing for more agile responses to changing circumstances and emerging challenges.\n\nThe sharing economy reimagined\n\nIn recent years, the sharing economy emerged as a powerful force, embodied by platforms like Uber and Airbnb. However, these platforms faced criticism for their centralized control and negative impacts, contradicting claimed benefits. DePIN seeks to address these shortcomings by embracing the principles of the sharing economy in a more inclusive and decentralized manner.\n\nConsider DRIFE, a DePIN rideshare app. DRIFE operates as a decentralized protocol, with a zero-commission fee structure allowing drivers to earn more income while passing savings on to riders. Drivers receive tokens as a reward for their services and play an active role in protocol governance, creating a more equitable and participatory model. DRIFE will utilize key Sui primitives, such as zkLogin, enabling frictionless user interaction through simple Sui address creation and management.\n\nDRIFE aims to disrupt the ridesharing market leveraging Sui technology.\n\nDePIN enables a myriad of innovative use cases, ranging from decentralized storage and mapping services to GPU rendering platforms and wireless IoT networks. These projects harness the power of decentralized infrastructure to create more efficient, cost-effective, and inclusive solutions for the world.\n\nLeveraging Sui technology for DePIN\n\nFor DePIN to thrive, it is crucial that the underlying blockchain network provides essential features and capabilities allowing teams to build innovative products without barriers.\n\nFirstly, scalability and high throughput are paramount. DePIN projects often involve mass amounts of transactions and interactions between participants, requiring a blockchain network capable of processing a high volume of transactions quickly and efficiently. Without scalability, the network may become congested, leading to delays and increased transaction costs, hindering the seamless operation of DePIN protocols. Sui offers best-in-class throughput and scalability with groundbreaking protocols, such as Mysticeti and Pilotfish.\n\nAdditionally, powerful developer tools are essential for building and deploying DePIN apps. Sui primitives such as zkLogin, sponsored transactions, programmable transaction blocks, and Sui Kiosk give developers powerful tools to build upon and create unique experiences and incentive structures. With these tools, app builders can streamline the development process, reducing complexity in integrating within existing infrastructure systems.  \n\nDePIN projects on Sui\n\nDRIFE, Karrier One, and Chirp are three of the most prominent examples of DePIN projects building on Sui, tackling transportation, telecommunications, and IoT connectivity. \n\nKarrier One is revolutionizing the telecom landscape with a decentralized, carrier-grade network, establishing infrastructure and partnerships to ensure global 5G coverage. Karrier One streamlines deployment processes and guarantees data integrity through its user-run radio network. Leveraging zkLogin, Karrier One offers US and Canadian phone numbers as NFTs, safeguarding against SIM swap fraud and enhancing accessibility for remote populations. Addressing connectivity disparities worldwide, Karrier One endeavors to provide reliable and affordable solutions, irrespective of geographic location, challenging conventional telecom standards.\n\nChirp is a global telecommunications network on Sui simplifying IoT deployment for businesses and residential uses. With the goal of simplifying the deployment and management of IoT technology, Chirp serves as a single partner for commercial customers, offering unified connectivity and a streamlined management platform. Chirp empowers residential users by automating daily tasks and enhancing security measures. Homeowners can leverage Chirp's technology to monitor and automate their homes, as well as track things like pets or vehicles using tracking devices connected to the Chirp network.\n\nDecentralize everything\n\nBy embracing decentralization, collaboration, and inclusivity, DePIN holds the key to unlocking a future where infrastructure is not just a means to an end but is harnessed for positive change. Utilizing the powerful network capabilities of Sui and key primitives, innovative DePIN projects can grow and reach the masses building on Sui.\n\n\nNote: This content is for general educational and informational purposes only and should not be construed or relied upon as an endorsement or recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any asset, investment or financial product and does not constitute financial, legal, or tax advice.\n\nREAD NEXT\nThe Top 3 Mobile Wallets on Sui\nMobile wallets are crucial to increasing adoption and accessibility.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAY 15, 2024\nMysticeti Set to Supercharge Consensus on Sui\nA new design for blockchain consensus reduces latency below Sui's already record-breaking speeds.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 10, 2024\nTencent Blockchain RPC Service Now Supports Sui\nSui developers will find a variety of plans supporting apps of all sizes.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 28, 2024\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

      "html": "Sui.io\nHome\nAbout\nContribute an Article\nCRYPTOGRAPHY\nAll About Zero Knowledge Proofs\nSui Foundation\nAug 16, 2023\n2 min\n\nZero Knowledge Proofs enable trusted transactions while ensuring data privacy for transacting parties.\n\nSui natively supports a technology called Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), which lets people securely transact with each other online while keeping their personal information private. An important aspect of ZKPs is how they let a person trust a transaction while knowing little about the other party to that transaction.\n\nZKPs are often used to verify the identities of transacting parties, but may also verify other data. For example, a ZKP may verify that a purchaser has the funds to buy something, without showing the seller the exact amount of funds in the account.\n\nZKPs satisfy Sui users' desire for privacy while also allowing trustworthy transactions.\n\nPractical ZKPs\n\nAs a ZKP example in the physical world, a person may give their credit card to a cashier to complete a purchase. To verify ownership of the credit card, the cashier asks to see a signed photo ID. Comparing the signatures on credit card and ID, and the photo on the ID with the person presenting the credit card, the cashier verifies the person is the proper owner of the card. Importantly in this case, the cashier only uses the signature and photo to verify ownership, while not needing to delve any further into the person's background.\n\nZKPs take this real-world verification and translate it to the online world using a computational model. They employ a variety of equations that verify one party in a transaction knows a specific piece of information without revealing that specific information to the other party. Because of the need to keep the sensitive data secret, these equations typically offer a very high degree of probability that the first party knows the data, without giving 100 percent certainty. However, the probability is so high that it can be used for trusted transactions.\n\nOn Sui, the Move API can use a version of ZKP called Groth16, part of a family called Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Argument of Knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs). Groth16, named after its inventor Jens Groth, a professor at University College London, is a system for performing ZKPs, and in the Sui implementation can use either the BN254 or BLS12-381 elliptic curve constructions, algorithms needed to compute the proofs.\n\nThe computational models required to run ZKPs can be resource intensive, taking time and requiring a lot of processing power. Groth16 notably runs more efficiently than other ZKP systems, making it suitable for Sui's decentralized network.\n\nPrivacy and trust\n\nOne bedrock of blockchain networks involves trading digital assets of value. Online networks can't offer the kinds of face-to-face interactions used in real-world transactions, where a buyer may receive a physical object to verify the transaction's validity. On the opposite pole, Web2 transactions require a high degree of implicit trust and add-on systems, such as entirely separate banking networks.\n\n\nThe ability to make trusted transactions is baked into Sui. Through its APIs, Sui natively supports the latest technologies to ensure privacy and trust between transacting parties.\n\n\nThe Sui documentation gives code snippets and a great start for implementing ZKPs.\n\n\nREAD NEXT\nzkLogin Adds Multi-sig Recovery, Apple Credentials\nAn update to zkLogin further extends its capabilities, giving users new options and adding use cases.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAY 9, 2024\nzkLogin Demystified: Exploring Sui's Cutting-Edge Authentication\nZero knowledge proofs allow users to create Sui addresses with common web credentials\nSUI FOUNDATION\nOCT 10, 2023\nIntegrating Encryption in the ComingChat App\nIn our social platform, we provide encrypted chat and a means of securely sending digital assets leveraging the Signal encryption protocol.\nCOMINGCHAT\nAUG 14, 2023\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

      "html": "Sui.io\nHome\nAbout\nContribute an Article\nCRYPTOGRAPHY\nClosing of CRS Ceremony Kickstarts the Launch of zkLogin\nSui Foundation\nSep 29, 2023\n4 min\n\nOver 100 participants contributed to the success of the ceremony\n\nLast week, the Sui Foundation successfully hosted the zkLogin ceremony, an important step towards the release of Sui’s new authentication primitive on Mainnet. zkLogin allows users to generate a wallet address from their Web2 credentials, such as Google or Twitch, using OAuth. To preserve the privacy of the OAuth artifacts, a zero-knowledge proof of possession is provided to verify that in fact the user has been authorized without revealing the artifact itself.\n\nzkLogin employs the Groth16 zkSNARK construction to instantiate the zero-knowledge proofs, and in order to achieve greater efficiencies, Groth16 needs a computation-specific Common Reference String (CRS) setup by a trusted party. As zkLogin is expected to ensure the safe-keeping of high value transactions and the integrity of critical smart contracts, the security of the system can’t rely on the honesty of a single entity. Instead, to generate the CRS for the zkLogin circuit, Sui must run a protocol which bases its security on the assumed honesty of a small fraction of a large number of parties. The zkLogin ceremony was the process by which these parties created the necessary CRS.\n\nWhat was the ceremony?\n\nThe Sui zkLogin ceremony was essentially a cryptographic multi-party computation (MPC) performed by a diverse group of participants to generate this CRS and follows the MPC protocol MMORPG described by Bowe, Gabizon and Miers. The protocol roughly proceeds in 2 phases. The first phase results in a series of powers of a secret quantity τ in the exponent of an elliptic curve element g, that is, of the form g, gτ, gτ2,...,gτn. Since this phase is circuit-agnostic, we adopted the result of the existing community contributed perpetual powers of tau. Our ceremony was the second phase, which is specific to the zkLogin circuit.\n\nThe MMORPG protocol allows an indefinite number of parties to participate in sequence, without the need of any prior synchronization or ordering. Each party needs to download the output of the previous party, generate randomness of its own, and then layer it on top of the received result, producing its own contribution, which is then relayed to the next party. The protocol guarantees security, if at least one of the participants follows the protocol faithfully, generates strong randomness and discards it reliably.\n\nHow was the ceremony performed?\n\nInvitations were sent to 100+ people with diverse backgrounds and affiliations: Sui validators, cryptographers, Web3 experts, world-renowned academics, and business leaders. The ceremony was planned for September 12-15 (later extended to September 18). Participants could join when they wanted with no fixed slots or appointments.\n\nSince the MPC is sequential, each contributor had to wait until the previous contributor finished in order to receive the previous contribution, follow the MPC steps, and produce their own contribution. Due to this structure, participants waited in a queue while those who joined before them finished. To authenticate participants, each participant received a unique activation code. The activation code was the secret key of a signing key pair, which had a dual purpose: it allowed the coordination server to associate the participant’s email with the contribution, and it verified the contribution with the corresponding public key.\n\nParticipants had two ways to contribute: through a browser or a docker. The browser option was the more user-friendly as all parts of the process happened in the browser. The Docker option required Docker setup but was more transparent—the Dockerfile and contributor source code are open-sourced and the whole process is verifiable. The browser option utilized snarkjs while the Docker option utilized Kobi’s implementation. This provided software variety so that contributors could choose whichever method they trust most. In addition, participants could generate entropy via entering random text or making random cursor movements.\n\nThe zkLogin circuit and the ceremony client code were made open source and the links were made available to the participants to review before the ceremony, if they chose to do so. In addition, developer docs and an audit report on the circuit from zkSecurity were posted for review. Challenge #0081 was adopted (resulting from 80 community contributions) from perpetual powers of tau in phase 1, which is circuit agnostic. The output of the Drand random beacon at epoch #3298000 was applied to remove bias. For phase 2, the ceremony had 111 contributions, 82 from the browser and 29 from Docker. Finally, the output of the Drand random beacon at epoch #3320606 was applied to remove bias from contributions. All intermediate files can be reproduced following instructions here for phase 1 and here for phase 2.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nThe final CRS along with the transcript of every participant’s contribution is available in a public repository. Contributors received both the hash of the previous contribution they were working on and the resulting hash after their contribution, displayed on-screen and sent via email. They can compare these hashes with the transcripts publicly available on the ceremony site. In addition, anyone is able to check that the hashes are computed correctly and each contribution is properly incorporated in the finalized parameters.\n\nParticipants were requested to choose if they want their name and affiliation to be published. For anonymous participants, the Sui Foundation will know the participant’s email, but there won't be any public disclosure. Participants who consented to have their names published, are listed on Github.\n\nDevelopers can test out zkLogin equipped with the ceremony CRS using Sui’s docs.\n\nThank you!\n\nThe ceremony was an auspicious start to the launch of zkLogin. While it wasn’t without ups and downs, particularly the early rush that resulted in long wait times, the lessons learned will help significantly for future ceremonies.\n\nThe Sui community is grateful beyond words to those who waited hours, made multiple attempts, and contributed precious time to leave their mark on the application. It is particularly exciting to see many participants share their experience via blogs and tweets!\n\nThanks to everyone who made this ceremony a success.

By using cutting-edge cryptography and technology, zkLogin is as elegant as it is intricate. This article delves into the mechanics of zkLogin, covers security aspects for users and builders, and explains how Sui’s design facilitates this innovative OAuth login process.\n\nLet’s dive in!\n\nHow zkLogin Works\n\nWith zkLogin a unique Sui address is created for each OAuth credential + app combination. A single OAuth credential can be used to manage independent addresses associated with an unlimited number of apps. For example, a single Google account connected to two different decentralized exchange apps will have two distinct Sui addresses—one for each app.\n\nFor a typical blockchain address, a persistent public-private key pair is associated with the address at the time of creation and the address identifier is derived from the public key. With zkLogin, addresses are associated with temporary key pairs which must be regenerated regularly through an OAuth login flow. By design, Sui addresses are able to remain fixed while the associated key pair can be changed. This is possible because zkLogin addresses are derived from a unique identifier obtained from the OAuth provider's returned payload called the “key claim”, rather than a public key. \n\nThe process for zkLogin is six sequential steps:\n\nStep 1: Generate ephemeral keys\n\nWhen a user opens the app, it generates a temporary, or ephemeral, keypair for the user. This keypair is given an expiration period which determines the frequency of required log-ins. \n\nStep 2: Generate a JSON Web Token (JWT)\n\nThe app prompts the user to authenticate themselves through an OAuth provider sign-in, yielding a JSON Web Token (JWT)—a digitally signed data payload from the provider. This JWT incorporates a nonce field, which, in the context of zkLogin, encompasses the public key alongside an expiration period. Embedded in the JWT is the key claim which is used to generate the Sui address later.\n\nStep 3: Request the user’s unique salt\n\nThe salt is an arbitrary string of numbers that is used in combination with the JWT and ephemeral keypair to associate the OAuth credentials with the Sui address. The path taken in this step is app dependent as there are different design options for builders. The zkLogin docs outline multiple options for salt management, each with their own tradeoffs.\n\nOne approach is an SSO-style salt management option that employs a salt service to store and provide the salt as needed. With this path, the app sends the JWT token to a salt service which returns the unique user salt upon validation of the JWT token. Another approach to salt management requires the user to set their salt when they log in for the first time and to manage it themselves, treating it as a password or pin.\n\nStep 4: Generate a zk proof\n\nArmed with the JWT token, salt, and public key, the process proceeds to request a zero-knowledge (zk) proof from a zk proving service. This crucial step rigorously scrutinizes the accuracy of the request by ensuring: 1) the nonce is defined correctly and includes the public key, 2) the key claim provided is consistent with the JWT, 3) the address is consistent with the key claim and user salt, and 4) the OAuth providers signature is correct. If any element fails to conform to expectations, the whole step will fail.\n\nStep 5: Identify the user's Sui address and construct transaction\n\nThe application then identifies the user’s Sui address based on the user salt and key claim extracted from the JWT. A transaction is endorsed using the private key bundled with the ephemeral signature, zk proof, and supplementary inputs from the JWT before being forwarded to Sui. \n\nStep 6: Validate transaction\n\nOnce on the blockchain, Sui validators meticulously scrutinize both the zk proof and the ephemeral signature for authentication. In the blink of an eye, the transaction is officially logged in Sui, seamlessly concluding the process.\n\nzkLogin natively facilitates a simple login process using OAuth credentials.\n\nSecurity Considerations\n\nJust as with any other “sign-in with X” functionality, users need to ensure the security of the account they use for logging in. If for any reason the user is unable to login with their OAuth credentials, they will not be able to access Sui addresses associated with that credential. Those who forget their password can resort to the standard recovery procedure provided by the OAuth service to restore access. \n\nIt is strongly advised that all OAuth accounts used in zkLogin operations incorporate two-factor authentication (2FA) to increase the security of both their OAuth provider account and their associated Sui addresses. Application builders should also encourage their users to implement security best practices, such as secure passwords and 2FA. It’s important to note that even if the OAuth account is compromised, for the hacker to access a Sui address via zkLogin, they must also acquire the user salt.\n\nApp builders should prioritize safeguarding and limiting exposure of the salt value. This value serves as the linchpin connecting users' Web2 and Web3 credentials, and its submission to the zk prover is pivotal. Therefore, it is highly advisable to host the zk proving service within the application's backend, effectively curbing any potential third-party access to the salt. Builders retain the option to independently develop their own zk prover by leveraging the readily available common reference string.\n\nFor more information on prover and salt management read the zkLogin best practices and business considerations for builders.\n\nSui is uniquely positioned for zkLogin\n\nSui’s cryptographic agility and object-oriented design enables a seamless OAuth login integration through zkLogin. Unlike most blockchains that inherently support only one cryptographic authentication method, Sui distinguishes itself by allowing the integration of various cryptographic schemes directly. This ability eliminates the need for users to incur additional gas costs for transaction execution using out-of-protocol cryptography. With Sui, the introduction of new native cryptographic authentication methods maintains compatibility with existing systems, ensuring users aren't disadvantaged for opting different cryptographic approaches.\n\nConventional Web3 OAuth login solutions rely on smart contracts for JSON web keys (JWKs), necessitating trust in the accuracy of oracle data posting. Sui revolutionizes this process by representing JWKs as Sui objects, consolidating validation. With zkLogin, Sui validators take on the role of oracles, ensuring adherence to the predefined rules for JWKs verification. This streamlined approach enhances security and reliability in the authentication process.\n\nLooking forward\n\nAs zkLogin takes its inaugural steps on mainnet, we anticipate an exciting future with the incorporation of additional OAuth providers and enhanced functionality. zkLogin marks a significant milestone for the Sui ecosystem, yet the real thrill lies ahead as builders take the reins to integrate zkLogin into their apps. The vast potential of implementing this primitive will inevitably trigger an evolution for the ecosystem. The journey has only just begun and possibilities are boundless.\n\nFor more details on how to integrate zkLogin into your app, visit the zkLogin documentation.\n\nREAD NEXT\nThe Top 3 Mobile Wallets on Sui\nMobile wallets are crucial to increasing adoption and accessibility.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAY 15, 2024\nzkLogin Adds Multi-sig Recovery, Apple Credentials\nAn update to zkLogin further extends its capabilities, giving users new options and adding use cases.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAY 9, 2024\nMysticeti Set to Supercharge Consensus on Sui\nA new design for blockchain consensus reduces latency below Sui's already record-breaking speeds.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 10, 2024\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

      "html": "Sui.io\nHome\nAbout\nContribute an Article\nCRYPTOGRAPHY\nSecure Your Web3 Private Keys\nSui Foundation\nDec 7, 2023\n5 min\n\nSecuring your Web3 accounts' private keys protects your tokens and digital assets.\n\nWhen you install a wallet and create a Sui account, the wallet contains a public and a private key. Keeping that private key safe and secure is essential for protecting your Sui assets, including any tokens in your wallet. \n\nPublic key cryptography, developed decades ago, is the basis for most secure transactions on the Internet today, including on Sui. With this type of cryptography, users have a public and private key. The public key lets anyone securely send you a message or digital asset, but only the private key can decrypt and access those messages or assets. It's okay to share the public key online, but under no circumstance should you share the private key.\n\nParticularly, be cautious of phishing attempts or scams requesting private key information. Legitimate entities will NEVER ask for private keys. \n\nDigital signatures \n\nBeyond decrypting messages encoded with a public key, private keys are used to create digital signatures and grant access to your assets. They authenticate ownership and enable control over digital holdings. When you conduct a transaction or interact with assets on Sui, your private key signs off on these actions, confirming that you are the rightful owner authorizing the transfer or operation. \n\nIn essence, private keys are the gateway to managing and securing your digital assets on the blockchain and should not be shared with anyone. \n\nPrivate key security best practices\n\nOne of the most important steps to keeping your private key secure is to make a secret copy and store it safely in different places, such as an offline drive or in protected online storage.\n\nCold storage\n\nConsider storing a majority of your assets offline, referred to as \"cold storage.\" Offline storage reduces exposure to online threats, such as hacking attempts or phishing attacks. \n\nHard copies, meaning paper, works as a form of cold storage for cryptocurrencies or digital assets. You can simply print out your private key and store it in a safe or safe deposit box. For ease of use, consider entering your private key into either an app or web-based QR code generator, printing the resultant QR code and storing it in a safe or safe deposit box. The QR code will make it much easier to input your private key when you need it, but make sure to use a trustworthy app or website to generate it.\nExplore hardware-based solutions such as hardware wallets that store keys within a secure physical device. These gadgets offer an added layer of protection against online threats by keeping the keys offline.\nKeep in mind, cold storage protects your private keys from many attacks, but does not protect users from signing malicious transactions that can sweep all the funds held by the key. Always review transactions being signed.\nSecurity software\n\nPassword managers and digital vaults are readily available, with some built into operating systems. This type of software can also store your private keys. \n\nSecure your devices from malware by installing trusted security software. Make sure the password you use to access this software is also secure.\nMake sure to apply all updates to any security software you use, as companies regularly create patches and new versions to guard against new security threats. \nMulti-factor authentication\n\nRelying on an additional verification method, such as a phone number or software-generated code, multi-factor authentication (2FA) adds an additional layer of security beyond just a password. If your wallet or digital vault supports 2FA, this feature can help protect your private key.\n\nSome apps or wallets make 2FA optional, so you will need to enable it to get this extra layer of protection. \nConsider purchasing a device such as a YubiKey, which generates one-time passwords and other authentication codes that you can use to access your online accounts. \nRegular checkups\n\nScheduling time once a week or month to review your security setup not only helps keep your software up-to-date, but can also make it easier to find your private keys when you need them. \n\nPeriodically review your key storage methods and security settings.\nPeriodically test the recovery procedures for your accessing keys. Ensure these procedures are functional and that backup keys are accessible when needed.\nBe on the lookout for security alerts from any services you use, which might let you know if your password has been stolen. Some browsers also check your saved passwords against lists of compromised passwords. Immediately change any passwords that appear on these lists.\nTest transactions\n\nWhen using tokens to make a purchase on Sui, make sure the address for those tokens is accurate. For example, a vendor might have mistyped their address on a website or app.\n\nWhen making large transactions, consider sending a much smaller amount first to ensure it's going to the right person or account.\nMulti-signature transactions\n\nSome transactions, accounts, or wallets require a specific number of private keys to open or initiate them. Multi-signature accounts, for example, can be useful for groups that maintain a common treasury, ensuring that no one person can access it. Sui natively supports multi-signature transactions, so you may end up using one on the network.\n\nIf you're part of a group that uses a multi-signature account or wallet, never copy your private key to any messages or forums within that group. Everyone can individually use their own private keys to do their part in opening the account.\nReflexes to practice\n\nKeeping your private information secure doesn't have to be work. Develop regular habits to keep accounts secure.\n\nAdjust your wallet's auto-lock setting to activate after a brief period.\nNever import your password to other wallets.\nDo not use the same private key between different wallets, blockchains, or different networks. \nAvoid using public Wi-Fi or hotspot devices that do not belong to you when managing your wallet.\nRisks of insecure practices\n\nNeglecting private key security in a Web3 environment can lead to severe risks and consequences. If someone can access your wallet, they can transfer any tokens or assets to their own account. If someone has your private key, they might be able to take tokens or assets held for you by other sites, such as a decentralized exchange. \n\nAsset loss or theft: Compromised private keys can result in unauthorized access to digital assets, leading to theft or loss of cryptocurrencies or other digital holdings stored in associated wallets.\nFraud and hacking: Mishandled private keys are vulnerable to hacking, phishing attacks, or malware. Attackers can exploit weaknesses to gain control of accounts, manipulate transactions, or engage in fraudulent activities.\nIrreversible transactions: Once executed, transactions on the blockchain are generally irreversible. If private keys are compromised, any unauthorized transactions made cannot be undone, leading to permanent asset loss.\nData privacy violations: In some cases, private keys might be linked to personal information, making individuals susceptible to identity theft or privacy breaches if these keys are exposed or mismanaged.\n\nNeglecting to prioritize private key security increases susceptibility to a range of threats, potentially resulting in financial loss, legal issues, reputational damage, and privacy violations.\n\nKeep safe\n\nSecuring your Web3 private keys is paramount in safeguarding digital assets within the decentralized ecosystem. By following best practices users can significantly mitigate risks associated with potential exposure to online threats. Additionally, enabling multi-factor authentication, engaging in trial transactions on test networks before executing substantial transactions and ensuring regular checkups and updates of key storage methods bolster the overall security posture. \n\nNeglecting private key security can lead to severe consequences, including asset loss, data breaches, and irreversible transactions. By prioritizing the implementation of these best practices, users can fortify their defenses and navigate the Web3 landscape with confidence, ensuring the safety and integrity of their digital assets.\n\nREAD NEXT\nzkLogin Adds Multi-sig Recovery, Apple Credentials\nAn update to zkLogin further extends its capabilities, giving users new options and adding use cases.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAY 9, 2024\nzkLogin Demystified: Exploring Sui's Cutting-Edge Authentication\nZero knowledge proofs allow users to create Sui addresses with common web credentials\nSUI FOUNDATION\nOCT 10, 2023\nIntegrating Encryption in the ComingChat App\nIn our social platform, we provide encrypted chat and a means of securely sending digital assets leveraging the Signal encryption protocol.\nCOMINGCHAT\nAUG 14, 2023\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

      "html": "Sui.io\nHome\nAbout\nContribute an Article\nSUI ECOSYSTEM\nQuantum Temple Champions Regenerative Tourism Through NFTs\nSui Foundation\nApr 12, 2024\n7 min\n\nStartup Quantum Temple uses the Sui network to create authentic, dynamic travel experiences, give back to local communities, and revolutionize the travel industry.\n\nFrom finance to art, gaming to wireless, a broad range of industries have seen a flood of startups working to disrupt the status quo using blockchain technology. But the travel industry, which evokes visions of crowded airports, whirlwind tours, and luxury cruises, might seem too legacy-driven to embrace blockchain innovation. One startup thinks it’s high time that changes.\n\nQuantum Temple's digital platform brings transparency and community empowerment to travel through blockchain technology. Sui technologies like zkLogin, NFTs, and sponsored transactions provide the infrastructure that facilitates Web3 functionality in what is traditionally a very low-tech, consumer-centric industry.\n\nThe company recently announced its new Water Civilization experience, the first ever Web3-enabled travel experience at a UNESCO World Heritage Site, in partnership with the Indonesian Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy, Desa Manukaya Let, and Mysten Labs. Through this program, Quantum Temple gives tourists the chance to learn about Bali’s water heritage, water temples, and a ritual called water purification at Pura Tirta Empul, one of the most important and most visited sacred water temples in Bali. Powered by Sui technology, it is a one-of-a-kind experience that blends traditional tourism with innovative, blockchain-powered ticketing and NFT artifacts.\n\nQuantum Temple partnered with the Indonesian Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy to create the Water Civilization experience, giving tourists an opportunity to immerse themselves in a unique aspect of Balinese culture.\n\n“We chose Sui because it was one of the only protocols that was really focused on consumer applications, which is very, very exciting because that is not the case in other ecosystems,” said Quantum Temple founder and CEO Linda Adami. “We’re trying to embed every single thing that can smooth the user experience so that my mom can use it without any difficulty.”\n\nThough it might not be the first to come to mind, Adami sees travel as a path to mass adoption and onboarding of consumers into the Web3 world.\n\nRegenerating the world through blockchain\n\nThe concept of regenerative tourism lives at Quantum Temple's core. Whereas many sustainable travel initiatives focus on offsetting the harm caused by travel, regenerative travel attempts to leave places and local communities better off than they were.\n\nUnlike many of her peers, Adami didn’t come to blockchain technology through the cryptocurrency world. She was introduced to it while working with the Dubai government to find ways that pre-regulatory, cutting edge technologies–such as AI, 3D printing, and robotics automation–could be used for public good.\n\n“I saw how blockchain infrastructure could be used to unlock public value and to address a lot of the inefficiencies that are trapped in legacy industries,” she said.\n\nWhen Covid hit in 2020, she took a sabbatical in Bali, Indonesia, and that’s where she found the inspiration for her next big move: bringing equity and more rewarding experiences to the travel industry using blockchain technology.\n\nQuantum Temple invites tourists to take part in the water purification ritual at Pura Tirta Empul, one of the most sacred Balinese water temples.\n\nWhile in Bali, Adami learned that 70 percent of the local economy depends on tourism. When the pandemic shut down travel, the tourism industry in Bali came crashing down, and Adami saw that many people had to go back to farming just to put food on the table. \n\n“I spent a lot of time engaging with the local communities and understanding what was happening, what their life was like,” said Adami. “And I realized that even before the pandemic, tourism here was not fundamentally equitable.” \n\nDespite generating a great deal of income, revenue was not equitably distributed among the people serving the industry. In fact, the United Nations Tourism Organization estimates that for every $100 spent on a vacation in a developing country, only $5 stays in that country.\n\nAt the same time, she saw other problems with the traditional tourism model. For one, people increasingly crave authentic experiences during their travels but don’t always know where to find them. In addition, because so much of local travel is cash-based, local governments often struggle to access the data that could help them prevent overtourism.\n\nQuantum Temple’s Water Civilization experience features a visual anthropology exhibit in a custom bamboo knowledge corridor. Local, specially trained guides introduce travelers to 14 hidden spots that are rarely visited by tourists.\n\nSo she put her blockchain expertise to work making tourism more transparent and equitable, beginning in Indonesia. She founded Quantum Temple with two missions: to use blockchain, NFT, and cryptocurrency technologies to help developing countries launch past the legacy systems traditionally used by the travel industry, and to connect travelers with unmatched experiences that marry the physical and digital worlds of art and culture.\n\nLeveraging Sui technologies, Quantum Temple is transforming a highly consumer-focused industry in such a way that many people don’t even know they’re using the blockchain for the first time.\n\nModernizing the travel experience\n\nFor now, Quantum Temple predominantly focuses on experiences, meaning all the tours and activities people do once they arrive at a destination.\n\n“Eighty percent of this particular segment of the value chain of travel is offline,” said Adami, “so there’s an opportunity to help local communities and providers leapfrog directly to the future into a blockchain infrastructure.”\n\nThe starting point for users is the Quantum Temple Passport, a decentralized loyalty program that unlocks access to a whole suite of products and services, including in-person tours and experiences in Bali, NFTs and physical art, and crowdfunded programs benefiting local communities.\n\nBehind the scenes, signing up for the passport creates a non-custodial Sui wallet, and the passport is a dynamic, soulbound token on Sui. Easing entry, zkLogin lets people sign up using an existing account from services such as Google or Facebook. New users may not even know they now own an NFT, just that their QT Passport can only be used by them. This ability to serve Web2 users in a streamlined, intuitive way is crucial to Quantum Temple’s success in an industry where both users and providers are often not familiar with blockchain technology.\n\n“We were able to integrate zkLogin in four days,” said Adami. “And when we did that, we doubled our user base in less than one month.”\n\nQT Passport holders can book one-of-a-kind travel experiences in Bali, with NFT tickets being claimed on Sui. These NFT tickets are digital assets that function as collectible memories that are saved to users’ wallets. \n\nAngela Herliani Tanoesoedibjo, Indonesia's Vice Minister of Tourism, uses an NFT as a ticket for the Quantum Temple experience. These NFT tickets allow governments to better understand where tourists are going.\n\nAt least 70 percent of the money generated by these experiences stays in local Bali communities. When a trip is over, users see the local impact their experience had, onchain and displayed in their personal profile. Quantum Temple users can also contribute to the Impact Fund, a crowdfunding platform that supports a variety of local programs. \n\nIntroducing NFT and phygital souvenirs\n\nA uniquely modern element to travel created by Quantum Temple is the inventive mix of physical and digital assets that tourists can collect. Travelers can purchase physical souvenirs, such as wooden sculptures handmade by local master craftspeople and commissioned by Quantum Temple. In addition, Quantum Temple created an NFT collection, the Nagas of Bali, which they offered as a drop in partnership with Tradeport. Two lucky recipients win a trip to Bali, and all proceeds of the NFT program to towards regenerative tourism and cultural preservation in Bali.\n\nQuantum Temple is working to expand its art offerings, collaborating with local institutions to build a catalog of high-quality products crafted by locals, using blockchain to provide authenticity and provenance for the products. \n\n“We’re going hardcore with phygital in a serious way, where we’ll embed NFC chips, so it’s really about connecting physical with digital and digital with physical and guaranteeing provenance through embedded systems and hardware,” said Adami.\n\nTearing down data silos to ease overcrowding\n\nAnother way Quantum Temple seeks to benefit local communities is by working with governments to collect data that can be used to improve the visitor experience and ease overcrowding.\n\n“We’re trying to solve a pretty difficult data silo problem for local authorities,” said Adami. Right now, in the majority of emerging markets, 80 percent of cultural attractions are offline and completely undigitized. Even for the most popular destinations, including one Bali temple that receives an estimated 2 million visitors per year, visitation data is not reliable. And because on-site ticketing systems are typically cash-based and don’t communicate with each other, it’s impossible for local institutions to know how tourism flows from one cultural attraction to another.\n\n“Overtourism is a big problem in many parts of the world,” said Adami, “so one of the most exciting things Quantum Temple wants to do is connect the cultural landscape by embedding blockchain infrastructure into a lot of these sites to redistribute traffic to places that are not frequently visited.”\n\nAn ambitious itinerary\n\nFor now, Quantum Temple is running programs in about 10 communities in Bali, with plans to triple that in Bali this year, as well as expand to new destinations within Indonesia and five other countries in the near future. The company is also in talks with a global travel technology infrastructure company about ways to expand Quantum Temple’s decentralized, blockchain-based loyalty program to include airlines, hotels, and other hospitality companies. \n\nAdami sees all of this as an opportunity to help blockchain reach regular consumers.\n\n“I think we’re demonstrating to a lot of people that we can actually build user experiences that are for mass adoption and that anyone can use without worrying about the technicalities,” said Adami. “Ultimately, we want to change industries for the greater good, and we are showing how blockchain can unlock value and redistribute it for greater purposes in an industry.”\n\nREAD NEXT\nThe Top 3 Mobile Wallets on Sui\nMobile wallets are crucial to increasing adoption and accessibility.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAY 15, 2024\n5 Games Coming to Sui: A Glimpse into the Future of Gaming\nNew gaming experiences are created on Sui and numerous games are launching this year!\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 22, 2024\nSui funds University Researchers from KAIST, UCL, National University of Singapore\nSui Academic Research Awards provides funding to 17 researchers pushing the boundaries of blockchain-related technologies.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 14, 2024\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

The outcome of the game is then preserved as an NFT, which the player owns and can trade. To facilitate this process, players need to connect their Sui wallet to their account on our INNO platform. This connection is necessary to cover the gas fees associated with playing the game and minting the resulting NFT.\n\nThe user’s gameplay results are displayed in real-time on the leaderboard. Based on daily rankings, users receive Act tokens as rewards. These Act tokens enable participation in INNO Platform’s airdrop events.\n\nBRICK POP saves each game as an NFT and rewards players with Act tokens.\nBRICK POP contract structures\n\nBRICK POP's technical depth is particularly emphasized through three key contract data structures: PlayerBoard, Round, and LeaderBoard. These structures play a crucial role in the real-time management of game states, recording player achievements, and accurately managing competition between players. These contracts ensure that all interactions within the game are processed transparently and reliably, allowing players to perceive their progress.\n\nPlayerBoard structures\n\nWithin the game, the PlayerBoard data structure serves as a repository for the user’s progress and performance tracking. It encompasses key fields, including:\n\nplayer: This field captures the user’s contract address, indicating ownership of the corresponding NFT.\ncurrent_board: Here, the user’s current stage status is stored, providing a snapshot of their progress within the game.\n\nUpon completing gameplay, users are ranked based on their highest achieved score. This rank is recorded alongside an image URL (image_url), visually depicting the user’s position. Additionally, users have access to their gameplay history in their wallet, empowering them to review and reflect on their progress and achievements over time.\n\nstruct PlayerBoard has key, store {\n  id: UID,\n  board_num: u64,\n  player: address,\n  current_board: Round,\n  image_url: Url\n}\nRound structures\n\nWithin the game framework, the Round data structure monitors each instance of the shooting ball, encompassing key fields such as:\n\nstage: This crucial field dynamically logs the current game stage in real-time, offering insight into the player’s progress within the game.\nlast_update_date: This field plays a pivotal role in recording the latest timestamp of the shooting ball, effectively capturing the last instance of player activity.\n\nThe Round data structure serves as a comprehensive repository, meticulously documenting every attempt and outcome. By analyzing this data, the game gains valuable insights into the player’s gameplay patterns, ultimately enhancing the overall gaming experience for the user.\n\nstruct Round has store, copy, drop {\n  stage: u64,\n  last_update_date: u64\n}\nLeaderBoard structures\n\nThe LeaderBoard data structure serves as a cornerstone in fostering healthy competition among players, featuring essential fields such as:\n\nrank: This pivotal field meticulously records players’ ranks alongside their attained stage statuses, providing a comprehensive overview of their performance within the competitive system.\nmaxRankCoun: Here, the maximum number of players displayed on the LeaderBoard is determined. For instance, setting it to 10 ensures that it only showcases the top 10 players.\n\nThrough the LeaderBoard data structure, players are empowered to compare their progress with peers, fostering a sense of camaraderie and motivation to ascend to higher stages. This competitive environment not only encourages prolonged gameplay but also amplifies the overall enjoyment and engagement for players.\n\nstruct Leaderboard has key, store {\n  id: UID,\n  ranks: venctor<RankBoard>,\n  maxRankCount: u64,\n  minStage: u64\n}\nLeveraging Sui\n\nThe utilization of Sui blockchain technology in BRICK POP is integral to the core of the game. All transactions occurring during gameplay are recorded on the blockchain, securely storing each player’s game progress, achievements, and acquired NFTs. This allows players to verify their accomplishments and perceive their in-game activities as having tangible value.\n\nFurthermore, this technology ensures fair management of competition among players through the game’s leaderboard system, distributing rewards transparently and reliably.\n\nRevolutionizing the gaming experience\n\nThe combination of ONBUFF and Sui blockchain technology creates a new form of gaming experience through BRICK POP. This game emphasizes both technological innovation and user engagement, providing players with deeper interactions and opportunities for value creation.\n\nSuch innovation not only impacts the gaming industry but also extends the scope of blockchain technology applications.

      "html": "Sui.io\nHome\nAbout\nContribute an Article\nMOVE\nCreate and Execute PTBs on Sui with the Sui CLI\nMysten Labs\nMar 29, 2024\n10 min\n\nThe new CLI command streamlines programming on Sui for those who prefer the terminal and Bash scripts.\n\nA new command in Sui's command line interface (CLI) lets users create and execute Programmable Transaction Blocks (PTBs) directly from the terminal or a Bash script. This new command gives developers greater flexibility in implementing and executing PTBs.\n\nPTBs give developers a very powerful programming tool not available on other blockchains. The ability to chain multiple transactions together in a single executable may be taken for granted in the wider world of software engineering, but on blockchains it represents a fundamental leap forward.  \n\nUntil now, it was only possible to work with PTBs using one of the available SDKs. Now, developers who prefer working through the terminal and writing scripts have new means of using this powerful feature.\n\nCheck out the Sui CLI PTB command documentation for details and examples. \n\nThe example below shows the commands necessary to create a simple PTB. It creates three new coins with values 1000, 2000 , and 3000 MIST from the gas coin, and transfers them to the address:  0x02a212de6a9dfa3a69e22387acfbafbb1a9e591bd9d636e7895dcfc8de05f331 (note the @ in front of the address to indicate this is an address and not a hexadecimal). \n\nsui client ptb \\\n--assign to_address @0x02a212de6a9dfa3a69e22387acfbafbb1a9e591bd \\\n--split-coins gas [1000,2000,3000] \\\n--assign coins \\\n--transfer-objects to_address [coins.0, coins.1, coins.2] \\\n--gas-budget 5000000 \\\n--summary\n\nHere is the result message:\n\n╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮ \n│ PTB Execution Summary                                │ \n├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ \n│ Digest: 7S7XpkGns8mQ4mBUzjdM32xqNHGF2P1ErHSLbb4Chn2j │ \n│ Status: success                                      │\n│ Gas Cost Summary:                                    │ \n│ Storage Cost: 3952000                                │ \n│ Computation Cost: 1000000                            │ \n│ Storage Rebate: 978120                               │ \n│ Non-refundable Storage Fee: 9880                     │ \n╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯\nSui CLI PTB \n\nThe main philosophy behind CLI PTB support is to enable developers to build and execute PTBs from the command line. You can also write Bash scripts to construct and execute PTBs just as you would do from the command line, providing great flexibility when it comes to automating different tasks. \n\nThe sui client ptb command accepts the following options:\n\nsui client ptb -h\nBuild, preview, and execute programmable transaction blocks. Depending on your shell, you might have to use quotes around arrays or other passed values. Use --help to see examples for how to use the core functionality of this command.\n\nUsage: sui client ptb [OPTIONS]\n\nOptions:\n      --assign <NAME> <VALUE>                                         Assign a value to a variable name to use later in the PTB.\n      --gas-coin <ID>                                                 The object ID of the gas coin to use. If not specified, it will try to use the first gas coin that it finds that has at least\n                                                                      the requested gas-budget balance.\n      --gas-budget <MIST>                                             The gas budget for the transaction, in MIST.\n      --make-move-vec <TYPE> <[VALUES]>                               Given n-values of the same type, it constructs a vector. For non objects or an empty vector, the type tag must be specified.\n      --merge-coins <INTO_COIN> <[COIN OBJECTS]>                      Merge N coins into the provided coin.\n      --move-call <PACKAGE::MODULE::FUNCTION> <TYPE> <FUNCTION_ARGS>  Make a move call to a function.\n      --split-coins <COIN> <[AMOUNT]>                                 Split the coin into N coins as per the given array of amounts.\n      --transfer-objects <[OBJECTS]> <TO>                             Transfer objects to the specified address.\n      --publish <MOVE_PACKAGE_PATH>                                   Publish the Move package. It takes as input the folder where the package exists.\n      --upgrade <MOVE_PACKAGE_PATH>                                   Upgrade the move package. It takes as input the folder where the package exists.\n      --preview                                                       Preview the list of PTB transactions instead of executing them.\n      --summary                                                       Show only a short summary (digest, execution status, gas cost). Do not use this flag when you need all the transaction data\n                                                                      and the execution effects.\n      --warn-shadows                                                  Enable shadow warning when the same variable name is declared multiple times. Off by default.\n      --json                                                          Return command outputs in json format.\n  -h, --help                                                          Print help (see more with '--help')\nConcepts and features \n\nBesides using existing traditional PTB-related concepts, there are a few new concepts needed for this command.  \n\nReuse results or custom defined variables using the --assign command. \nPreview the input commands in the PTB instead of executing the PTB. \nWarn on declaring a variable with the same identifier multiple times. \nBenefit from name resolution for common packages such as sui, std, and deepbook (instead of using their addresses).\nError messages provide a concise and precise explanation of what is wrong in the PTB syntax.\nVariable names cannot be address, bool, vector, some, none, gas, u8, u16, u32, u64, u128, or u256.\nExamples \n\nLet’s dig through some examples to showcase the Sui CLI PTB tool's power. Note that these examples were tested using Bash, and your mileage might vary depending on your shell and how it treats and parses strings and quotes (e.g., you might need to use quotation marks around arrays in zsh or fish, but not in Bash).\n\nNested or multi-types \n\nWhen you need to work with nested types, you can simply wrap the types you need in < and >. For example, if an argument expects an Option<vector<u256>> you can write std::option::Option<vector<u256>>.\n\nHere is an example:\n\nsui client ptb \n--make-move-vec \"<std::option::Option<vector<u256>>>\" \"[vector[]]\" \\\n--gas-budget 5000000\n\nIf you need to pass multiple types for a call, you can do so by using a comma between the types, as in <u64,u8,bool,string>.\n\nName resolution \n\nCLI PTB uses name resolution for common packages like sui, std, and deepbook, so you can use them directly instead of their addresses: 0x2, 0x1, or 0xdee9. You can still use the traditional package::module::function way to call a specific function. For example, you can use both std::option or 0x1::option. \n\nsui client ptb \\\n--assign A none \\\n--move-call std::option::is_none \"<u64>\" A \\\n--gas-budget 5000000\n\nYou can also refer to addresses in your local wallet by their alias instead of their full address. \n\nAssign data to variables\n\nThe --assign argument binds values to variables. There are a few ways you can use it: \n\nAssign a value to a variable: \nsui client ptb \\\n--assign myvar 100 \\\n--gas-budget 5000000\nAssign a variable to the result of the previous transaction. In the following example, split-coins results in three new objects, which will be accessible via the coins variable due to the usage of --assign. \nsui client ptb \\\n--split-coins gas \"[1000,2000,3000]\" \\\n--assign coins \\\n--gas-budget 5000000\nAssign a variable to a different variable\nsui client ptb \\  \n--assign myvar vector[100, 200] \\  \n--assign my_addr @0x0fe375fff0ee40d20c54a7f2478b9b5c7eaa3625b761 \\  \n--assign old_address my_addr \\  \n--gas-budget 5000000\nPublish package and call function \n\nIn the Sui repository, the first package example is a simple Move project. In a nutshell, this example publishes that package, which creates a Forge object that you can use to create swords with the new_sword function. The code below assumes that you have a Sui Testnet environment set up and sufficient gas for your address. \n\nFirst, access the example folder and publish the package. \n\ncd sui/examples/move/first_package\nsui client ptb \n--move-call sui::tx_context::sender \\\n--assign \"sender\" \\\n--publish \".\" \\\n--assign upgrade_cap \\\n--transfer-objects [upgrade_cap] sender \\\n--gas-budget 50000000\n\nPublishing this package results in the following transaction data:\n\nINCLUDING DEPENDENCY Sui\nINCLUDING DEPENDENCY MoveStdlib\nBUILDING first_package\nSuccessfully verified dependencies on-chain against source.\n╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮\n│ PTB Execution Summary                                │\n├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│ Digest: 8ULSyjJXhX5CPiEge3a7T2kLSA3YA8V44BAGZPdknJ1h │\n│ Status: success                                      │\n│ Gas Cost Summary:                                    │\n│   Storage Cost: 9978800                              │\n│   Computation Cost: 1000000                          │\n│   Storage Rebate: 978120                             │\n│   Non-refundable Storage Fee: 9880                   │\n╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯\n\nFrom the previous result, we can use the digest and pass it to sui client tx-digest to find the packageId and the objectId for the Forge object. We want to forge a new sword and transfer it to the sender of this transaction. \n\nNext, we look up the function new_sword from the package we published to understand what arguments we need to pass to the function. Its signature is:\n\n/// Constructor for creating swords \n public fun new_sword( \n     forge: &mut Forge, \n     magic: u64, \n     strength: u64, \n     ctx: &mut TxContext, \n ): Sword \n\nNow that the package exists onchain, let’s use a PTB to create a sword. The first thing to do is to get the sender’s address with the move-call command and assign the result of that call to the sender variable. We can use assign for the magic and strength arguments, and assign the Forge object ID to the variable forge_obj.\n\nFinally, we call the new_sword function through the move-call command, pass all the right function arguments, assign the result of the move-call to the sword variable, and transfer the new sword object to the sender. \n\nsui client ptb \\\n--move-call sui::tx_context::sender \\\n--assign sender \\\n--assign magic 10u64 \\\n--assign strength 50u64 \\\n--assign forge_obj @0xd5d19fde64ea43876add02efb2a769372869f30118 \\\n--move-call  0xbe6edeefea02371d35fdde5a45033d8d8e2e00b3eb911b23fa::example::new_sword  forge_obj magic strength \\\n--assign sword \\\n--transfer-objects \"[sword]\" sender \\\n--gas-budget 5000000 \\\n--summary\n\nBecause we've set the --summary flag, the execution result reads:\n\n╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮ \n│ PTB Execution Summary                                │ \n├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ \n│ Digest: HYqWpN9sYBGLawj4BE9VnRM7qaezUFA8aLrGBbjf72L7 │ \n│ Status: success                                      │ \n│ Gas Cost Summary:                                    │ \n│    Storage Cost: 3739200                             │ \n│    Computation Cost: 1000000                         │ \n│    Storage Rebate: 2309868                           │ \n│    Non-refundable Storage Fee: 23332                 │ \n╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯ \nPTBs in a Bash script\n\nTo facilitate automation and reusability, you can copy and paste the PTB commands from the terminal into a Bash script and run it. \n\n#!/usr/bin/bash \n\nsui client ptb \\ \n--assign to_address @0x02a212de6a9dfa3a69e22387acfbafbb1a9e59\n--split-coins gas \"[1000,2000,3000]\" \\\n--assign coins \\\n--transfer-objects \"[coins.0, coins.1, coins.2]\" to_address \\\n--gas-budget 5000000\n\nThe above code can be run as a normal Bash script.\n\nMint 100 NFTs and transfer them using PTBs in a Bash script\n\nThis example uses a Bash script to mint 100 NFTs and transfer them to 100 addresses.

The project defines the function mint in the module num, which we declare.\n\nThe script then loads the addresses from a text file where each address is on a new line. It then builds a string of move-call commands, calling the mint function and transferring the object to an address, all in a for loop. Finally, the PTB is executed.\n\nNote that, being a Bash script, you can pass in environment variables as you’d do with any other Bash script.\n\nnum_issuer_cap=0x3e8a046807edd63b75014b9aff0f8dc30b76344a4dfdb1ae4655932e0514086b\npackage=0x610834b5fa960b297a5caf6af56bcc045d67d158889da5b511a20031307ce099\nmodule=num\nfun=mint\n\necho \"Loading addresses from file\"\nreadarray -t addresses < addresses.txt\n\ncmd=\"\"\nfor address in ${addresses[@]}; do\n  cmd+=\"--move-call $package::$module::$fun @$num_issuer_cap --assign X --transfer-objects [X] @$address \"\ndone\n\necho \"Executing PTB\"\nsui client ptb \\\n $cmd \\\n --gas-budget 5000000000 \\\n --summary\n\nThe end result is:\n\nbash-5.2$ bash working-demo.sh\nLoading addresses from file\nExecuting PTB\n╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮\n│ PTB Execution Summary                                │\n├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│ Digest: 7THBdpRHWSTiWExxSB7A3m9E7PDP9kQaD16N8xXevdcA │\n│ Status: success                                      │\n│ Gas Cost Summary:                                    │\n│   Storage Cost: 132376800                            │\n│   Computation Cost: 1000000                          │\n│   Storage Rebate: 2392632                            │\n│   Non-refundable Storage Fee: 24168                  │\n╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯\nPurchase of a domain on SuiNS \n\nThe following example registers a Sui domain name by first creating a zero coin that has no SUI, to be used for move-call, and after that it transfers the newly created domain name object to a specific address. \n\nsui client ptb \\\n--assign suins_object_id  @0x300369e8909b9a6464da265b9a5a9ab6fe2158a040e84e808628cde7a07ee5a3 \\\n--split-coins gas \"[0]\" \\\n--assign zero_coin \\\n--move-call 0x4255184a0143c0ce4394a3f16a6f5aa5d64507269e54e51ea396d569fe8f1ba5::register::register suins_object_id '\"mysui.sui\"' 1u8 zero_coin @0x6 \\\n--assign suins_name \\\n--transfer-objects \"[suins_name]\"  @0x0fe375fff0ee40d20c54a7f2478b9b5c7eaa3625b7611f9661ec5faefb4a6fea \\\n--gas-budget 50000000\n\nThe result of this command is:\n\n╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮\n│ PTB Execution Summary                                │\n├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│ Digest: 5D2W4beXGWzF4Cn69y6ihnTvoyBC99vb5zGhpxAhdq1z │\n│ Status: success                                      │\n│ Gas Cost Summary:                                    │\n│   Storage Cost: 10039600                             │\n│   Computation Cost: 1000000                          │\n│   Storage Rebate: 5394708                            │\n│   Non-refundable Storage Fee: 54492                  │ \n╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯\nPreview a PTB instead of executing \n\nThe --preview flag, useful for complex PTBs, lists the transactions in the PTB instead of executing it.

This helps when dealing with complex PTBs, as it will produce the list of transactions instead of executing the PTB. \n\nsui client ptb \\\n--assign to_address @0x02a212de6a9dfa3a69e22387acfbafbb1a9e59 \\\n--split-coins gas [1000,2000,3000] \\\n--assign coins \\\n--transfer-objects [coins.0, coins.1, coins.2] to_address \\\n--gas-budget 5000000 \\\n--summary \\\n--preview\n\nAnd the result of this call would be the following: \n\nClick image to expand it.\nWarnings and errors \n\nWhen using the --assign command and the --warn-shadows flag, the tool issues a warning when it encounters shadowed variables.

Here is an example:\n\nsui client ptb \\ \n--assign a 10 \\ \n--assign a 15 \\ \n--gas-budget 5000000 \\ \n--warn-shadows \n\nThe image below shows the warnings produced when building a PTB: \n\nClick image to expand it.\n\nOne area where we dedicated a lot of effort is on how to report useful errors. We aimed for errors to include sufficient information about what is wrong, pointing exactly to the argument that leads to that error, and in some cases even providing a hint on how to fix it.  \n\nFor example, if the user calls the std::Option::is_none function and passes the module name with an uppercase instead of lowercase, the tool will produce the following message: \n\nsui client ptb \\  \n--move-call std::Option::is_none none \\ \n--gas-budget 5000000\n\nAnd the error message will show the following: \n\nClick image to expand it.\n\n Here is another example which showcases the error produced when the user calls --assign X without passing a variable, after a command that does not produce any result: \n\nsui client ptb \\ \n--assign X \\ \n--gas-budget 5000000\n\nThe error in this case would be the following:\n\nClick image to expand it.\n\n Here is a another example regarding reserved words in the tool: \n\nsui client ptb --assign address 5 --gas-budget 5\n\nThe error message here would show:\n\nClick image to expand it.\nREAD NEXT\nLet's Move Sui Helps Developers who want to Move on Sui\nThose wanting to learn Move programming now have a fun and intuitive option with the launch of Let's Move Sui!\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 12, 2024\nAll About Smart Contracts\nIn their simplest form, smart contracts govern transactions, but the Sui Move programming language opens the possibility for much more sophisticated apps.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAUG 30, 2023\nAll About Kiosks\nThe Kiosk primitive on Sui lets builders quickly set up shops and sell digital assets, enforcing policies such as royalties that automatically collect fees for content creators.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAUG 23, 2023\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

      "html": "Sui.io\nHome\nAbout\nContribute an Article\nEVENTS\nHighlights from the Singapore Builder House\nSui Foundation\nSep 21, 2023\n3 min\n\nHundreds of builders joined for two days of keynotes, workshops, and networking to wrap up the global Builder House tour.\n\nThe last Builder House of 2023 took place in Singapore last week with keynotes, panels, and workshops focused on the present and future of Sui. zkLogin, a new Sui primitive that allows users to create accounts using Web2 credentials, was the highlight of the event with its potential to drive mass Web3 adoption.\n\nIn addition to the presentations and announcements, registrants for the liquid staking hackathon met with judges to discuss their projects, and applicants for developer and education grants met with Sui Foundation staff for project feedback. Of course, there was plenty of time for fun and networking as well as there were over 650 people in attendance over the two day event.\n\nzkLogin makes Web3 accessible\n\nAdeniyi Abiodun, Mysten Labs' Co-Founder and Chief Product Officer, presented a massive opportunity for users and enterprises with zkLogin. Native to Sui, this new primitive is set to be a game-changer for onboarding new users to Web3. zkLogin removes the friction experienced today during account creation by allowing people to use credentials from popular services such as Google, Twitch, and Microsoft. It eliminates the need to create new credentials and memorize a mnemonic or seed phrase. Simply input a Web2 username and password and get a unique Sui wallet for the app incorporating zkLogin. Zero-knowledge proofs keep the login credentials secure from the chain and chain activity private from the credentialing network.\n\nAdeniyi compared the number of active Web3 wallets, which sits at less than 100 million, to Web2 accounts, which number in the billions, to highlight the size of the gap and the potential simple sign-on primitives such as zkLogin have to usher in a new wave of users.\n\n“Complexity is the killer of adoption. The ultimate killer dApp is accessibility.” - Adeniyi Abiodun\n\nDevelopers interested in integrating zkLogin should check out the SDK and docs to get started.\n\nLooking at the big Web3 picture\n\nOn the first day of programming, participants listened to several panels focused on what is next for Web3, particularly in gaming and DeFi.\n\nBen Charbit from Life Beyond and Jin Lee from NHN joined Jameel Khalfan of Mysten Labs to discuss the draw of Web3 for games. Digital property rights create loyalty and engagement from players, a distinct differentiator from Web2-only games, and has inspired more traditional gaming studios to integrate Web3 technology. Given this push away from play-to-earn gaming, it was agreed that simpler onboarding, such as that available through zkLogin, is necessary for games to find wider audiences.\n\nMysten Labs' Alonso de Gotari chatted with Ray Pan from GSR and Mike Cahill from Duoro Labs about the next wave of decentralized finance. DeFi is home to technical and business innovation, but still remains a niche product compared to traditional finance. Ray discussed the need for builders to think about the role of market making in their projects. In addition, he mentioned that the development team should work to ensure the process of integration is smooth, including stable APIs and engineers available for support. Mike shared his desire to see more DEXes as leading markets for perpetual derivatives and the movement of products from the decentralized world on chain.\n\nVoices of the Sui community\n\nA wide variety of apps and projects from the Sui community were present at Builder House. Whether collaborating in the developer zone, participating in technical workshops led by the Sui Foundation Developer Relations team, or chatting at a networking event, everyone enjoyed the opportunity to connect and learn from one another.\n\nA few community projects took the main stage to share more about their work.\n\nCynthia Qu interviewed Josh Tobkin from SupraOracles, a pioneering cross-chain communication and oracle solution. Having integrated with most DeFi projects on Sui, he discussed the desire to not only offer reliable and secure oracles for the apps, but also to help educate the wider community about Sui.\n\nStreamflow, a product that helps organizations manage team finances on-chain, announced their launch on Sui with a keynote from the Builder House stage. They offer automated token vesting schedules, token locks, staking, and airdrops, all with a goal of helping projects succeed with their whole token lifecycle.\nA vision for Web3 and Sui\n\nDuring a Founders AMA, Adeniyi joined Sui Foundation Managing Director Greg Siourounis on stage to share their candid thoughts on what’s next for blockchain and Sui. They emphasized the key to success going forward is to serve consumer needs with differentiated products that compete with Web2. By solving real problems through ownership, and removing unnecessary friction in the user experience, adoption can accelerate and break out of its current nice state. As Adeniyi put it, product teams like Mysten Labs should aim to bring empathy back to the center of the development process.\n\nA heartfelt thank you\n\nBuilder House Singapore could not have been the rousing success it was without our generous sponsors. Their support of and commitment to the Sui community is unparalleled and greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you to our Global sponsor Jump, Platinum sponsors GSR and Alibaba Cloud, and Gold sponsors angelhack and HyperBC.\n\nAnd of course, thank you to all who were able to join us at this, and every, Builder House in 2023. It has been a tremendous year for the Sui community and we look forward to welcoming everyone to many more events in 2024.\n\nREAD NEXT\nDive into Sui Overflow: Sui’s First Global Hackathon\nJoin us at Sui Overflow to push the boundaries of what is possible in Web3.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 20, 2024\nGames on Sui Handle Millions of Transactions During Quest 3\nSui's scalability and resilience delivers seamless gameplay under heavy demand.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nNOV 15, 2023\nSui Hackathon Winners Build On-Chain Item Verification and an Improved Dutch Auction\nStudents from across Europe submitted a variety of projects showing Sui's potential over the weekend of October 21 to 22.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nNOV 9, 2023\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

      "html": "Sui.io\nHome\nAbout\nContribute an Article\nMOVE\nMigrate to Move 2024\nMysten Labs\nApr 3, 2024\n7 min\n\nMove 2024 offers new features, including method syntax, positional fields, and loop labels.\n\nMigrating to the Move 2024 edition introduces changes that make Move easier to write, and hopefully easier to read. The relatively few breaking changes in the source language better position Move to handle future advancements.\n\nMany of these changes enhance the source language, affecting the compiler without requiring any changes to the binary representation published on chain.\n\nExisting code will continue to compile, even with the addition of these new features. And because these features are opt-in, you can write your packages with the new features, even if your dependencies do not include them. Opting to take advantage of the new features in your current modules, however, introduces a few breaking changes.\n\nRead our migration guide on GitHub for full details.\n\nHow to migrate\n\nTo migrate a project to Move 2024 Beta, you have two options:\n\nDelete your existing Move.lock file (if one exists) to make sure you're using the newest sui-framework version.\nRun sui move migrate in the root of your Move project. See the Automatic migration section of the migration guide for more information.\nAlternatively, update your Move.toml file's [package] entry to include edition = \"2024.beta\". If you do this, you might receive a number of new errors as part of our breaking changes.\nAutomatic migration \n\nMove 2024 includes an automatic migration script that you can use by calling sui move migrate in the root of your Move project. Upon running, your console prompts you for which Move edition to use. If you select 2024.beta, the script invokes the compiler and attempts to automatically update your code to avoid the breaking changes the update introduces (including marking structs as public, mutable variables with the mut keyword, avoiding restricted keywords, swapping friends for public(package), and even updating paths to global paths in many cases).\n\nAfter this script runs, your console displays a diff of the changes the script intends to make. If you accept the changes, the script updates your code and your Move.toml file automatically. You are now using Move 2024 Beta.\n\nNew features\n\nHere is a brief overview of some of the new features in Move 2024.\n\nMethod syntax\n\nYou can call certain functions now as methods using the . syntax. For example, the following call:\n\nvector::push_back(&mut v, coin::value(&c));\n\ncan now be written as:\n\nv.push_back(c.value());\n\nWhere the receiver of the method (v and c in this example) is automatically borrowed if necessary (as &mut v and &c respectively).\n\nYou can call any function defined in the same module as the receiver's type as a method if it takes the receiver as its first argument.\n\nFor functions defined outside the module, you can declare methods using public use fun and use fun.\n\nIndex syntax\n\nWith method syntax, you can annotate certain functions as being #[syntax(index)] methods. You then call these methods using v[i]-style calls.\n\nFor example,\n\n*&mut v[i] = v[j];\n\nresolves to\n\n*vector::borrow_mut(&mut v, i) = *vector::borrow(&v, j);\npublic(package)\n\nfriend declarations, and the associated public(friend) visibility modifiers, are deprecated. In their place is the public(package) visibility modifier, which allows calling functions only within the same package where they are defined.\n\nPositional fields\n\nYou can now define structs with positional fields, which are accessed by a zero-based index. For example,\n\npublic struct Pair(u64, u64) has copy, drop, store;\n\nthen to access each field,\n\npublic fun sum(p: &Pair): u64 {\n  p.0 + p.1\n}\n\nAnd as this example shows, you can now declare abilities after the struct field list.\n\nNested use and standard library defaults\n\nYou can now nest use aliases for more conciseness.\n\nuse sui::{balance, coin::{Self, Coin}};\n\nAdditionally, the following use declarations are now automatically included in every module:\n\nuse std::vector;\nuse std::option::{Self, Option};\nuse sui::object::{Self, ID, UID};\nuse sui::transfer;\nuse sui::tx_context::{Self, TxContext};\nAutomatic referencing in equality\n\nEquality operations, == and !=, now automatically borrow if one side is a reference and the other is not. For example,\n\nfun check(x: u64, r: &u64): bool {\n  x == r\n}\n\nis equivalent to\n\nfun check(x: u64, r: &u64): bool {\n  &x == r\n}\n\nThis automatic borrowing can occur on either side of == and !=.\n\nLoop labels\n\nWhen nesting loops, it can be convenient to break to the outer loop. For example,\n\nlet mut i = 0;\nlet mut j = 0;\nlet mut terminate_loop = false;\nwhile (i < 10) {\n    while (j < 10) {\n        if (haystack(i, j) == needle) {\n            terminate_loop = true;\n            break;\n        };\n        j = j + 1;\n    };\n    if (terminate_loop) break;\n    i = i + 1;\n}\n\nNow, you can directly name the outer loop (outer in this case) and break it all at once:\n\nlet mut i = 0;\nlet mut j = 0;\n'outer: while (i < 10) {\n    while (j < 10) {\n        if (haystack(i, j) == needle) break'outer;\n        j = j + 1;\n    };\n    i = i + 1;\n}\nbreak with value\n\nIt's now possible to break with a value from a loop. For example,\n\nlet mut i = 0;\nlet x: u64 = loop {\n    if (v[i] > 10) break i;\n    i = i + 1;\n};\n\nYou can achieve this with labels, as well. For example,\n\nlet mut i = 0;\nlet mut j = 0;\nlet item = 'outer: loop {\n    while (j < 10) {\n        let item = haystack(i, j);\n        if (item == needle) break'outer option::some(item);\n        j = j + 1;\n    };\n    i = i + 1;\n    if (i == 10) break option::none();\n};\nBreaking changes \n\nBreaking changes are, unfortunately, a growing pain in Move 2024. We anticipate these changes to be minimally invasive and provided a migration script to automate them in most cases. In addition, these changes pave the way for new features still to come in Move 2024.\n\nDatatype visibility requirements\n\nCurrently, all structs in Move are, by convention, public: any other module or package can import them and refer to them by type. To make this clearer, Move 2024 requires that all structs be declared with the public keyword. For example,\n\n// legacy code\nstruct S { x: u64 }\n\n// Move 2024 code\npublic struct S { x: u64 }\n\nAny non-public struct produces an error at this time, although the Move team is working on new visibility options for future releases.\n\nMutability requirements\n\nPreviously, all variables in Move were implicitly mutable. For example,\n\nfun f(s: S, y: u64): u64 {\n    let a = 0;\n    let S { x } = s;\n    a = 1;\n    x = 10;\n    y = 5;\n    x + y\n}\n\nNow, you must declare mutable variables explicitly:\n\nfun f(s: S, mut y: u64): u64 {\n    let mut a = 0;\n    let S { mut x } = 5;\n    a = 1;\n    x = 10;\n    y = 5;\n    x + y\n}\n\nThe compiler now produces an error if you attempt to reassign or borrow a variable mutably without this explicit declaration.\n\nRemoving friends and public(friend)\n\nFriends and the public(friend) visibilities were introduced early in Move's development, predating even the package system. As indicated in the public(package) section, public(package) deprecates public(friend) in Move 2024.\n\nThe following declaration now produces an error:\n\nmodule pkg::m {\n    friend pkg::a;\n    public(friend) fun f() { ... }\n}\n\nmodule pkg::a {\n    fun calls_f() { ... pkg::m::f() ... }\n}\n\nInstead, if you want your function to be visible only in the package, write:\n\nmodule pkg::m {\n    public(package) fun f() { ... }\n}\n\nmodule pkg::a {\n    // this now works directly\n    fun calls_f() { ... pkg::m::f() ... }\n}\nNew keywords\n\nLooking toward the future, Move 2024 Beta adds the following keywords to the language: enum, for, match, mut, and type. The compiler, unfortunately, now produces parsing errors when it finds these in other positions. This is a necessary change as the language matures. If you perform automatic migration, the migration tool renames these as enum and so on, rewriting the code to use these escaped forms.\n\nRevised paths and namespaces\n\nMove 2024 revises how paths and namespaces work compared to legacy Move, toward easing enum aliasing in the future. Consider the following snippet from a test annotation in the sui_system library:\n\nuse sui_system::sui_system;\n\n...\n\n#[expected_failure(abort_code = sui_system::validator_set::EInvalidCap)]\n\nLegacy Move would always treat a three-part name as an address (sui_system), module (validator_set), and module member (EInvalidCap). Move 2024 respects scope for use, so sui_system in the attribute resolves to the module, producing a name resolution error overall.\n\nTo avoid cases where this is the intended behavior, Move 2024 introduces a prefix operation for global qualification. To use it, you can rewrite this annotation as:\n\nuse sui_system::sui_system;\n\n...\n\n#[expected_failure(abort_code = ::sui_system::validator_set::EInvalidCap)]\n                             // ^ note `::` here\n\nThe migration script attempts to remediate naming errors using global qualification when possible.\n\nFollow along\n\nThe beta release of Move 2024 comes with some powerful new features beyond the breaking changes described here. There are also more on the horizon. Join the Sui newsletter to learn about new, exciting features coming to Move this year, including syntactic macros, enums with pattern matching, and other user-defined syntax extensions.\n\nPlease, provide any feedback or report any issues you encounter via GitHub, Discord, or the Sui Developer Forums.\n\nREAD NEXT\nLet's Move Sui Helps Developers who want to Move on Sui\nThose wanting to learn Move programming now have a fun and intuitive option with the launch of Let's Move Sui!\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 12, 2024\nAll About Smart Contracts\nIn their simplest form, smart contracts govern transactions, but the Sui Move programming language opens the possibility for much more sophisticated apps.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAUG 30, 2023\nAll About Kiosks\nThe Kiosk primitive on Sui lets builders quickly set up shops and sell digital assets, enforcing policies such as royalties that automatically collect fees for content creators.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAUG 23, 2023\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

However, the conclusion of Quest 3 proved beyond a doubt Sui's exceptional capabilities as participating games delivered millions of transactions. \n\nQuest 3 showcased gaming projects, giving builders an opportunity to introduce their exciting creations to potential players. These players were incentivized to engage with nine projects over a month, ending on November 9, 2023. Quest 1, smaller in scope, also focused on games, while Quest 2 demonstrated DeFi apps on Sui. \n\nIndividual projects, such as Panzerdogs and Arcade Champion, reported player adoption running in the hundreds of thousands, with millions of in-game interactions in some cases. Not only did Sui support this demand with 100 percent uptime, but gas fees remained steady, with no spikes caused by high demand.\n\nGas fees, in blue, maintained a reasonable rate during Quest 3, showing no significant spikes even as transaction volume, in black, increased.\n\nDuring Quest 3, gas prices on Sui maintained a range from approximately 750 to 825 MIST, a denomination equal to a billionth of a SUI. The network maintained this range despite an increase in network traffic, ensuring that apps didn't cost more to use as demand rose.\n\nIndividual game results\n\nArcade Champion, an arcade-style battle game built by Bluejay Games, gained over 248,000 players during Quest 3. The game features AI-controlled characters that battle and evolve for their player-owners. Leveraging Sui's object-focused data structure, each character is actually an NFT hosted on the network. \n\nIn Arcade Champion, players use AI-controlled characters to battle, gaining levels and the ability to fuse.\n\nPlayers engaged in over 7.3 million minigames, which include both solo missions and head-to-head duels, with players leveling their characters 30,612,753 times over the course of Quest 3. As a testament to Sui's resilience, Arcade Champion recorded over 1 million daily transactions, with a peak of 1.9 million.\n\nPanzerdogs, by Lucky Kat Studios, showed equally impressive numbers during Quest 3. It saw over 300,000 new accounts and 1.5 million matches between players over 30 days. \"Quest 3 provided us with easy to integrate systems, valuable insights on how our game can handle a mass of players at one time, and introduced Panzerdogs to over 300,000 new players,\" said a representative from Lucky Kat. Boasting over 30,000 daily average users, Panzerdogs and Sui delivered a satisfying experience for gamers.\n\nThe simple but engaging DeSui Coinflip showed strong results as well. The game features a coin flip wager, with a fifty-fifty chance of winning. During Quest 3, players made over 1.5 million coin flips, each representing an onchain transaction. Of its participation in the Quest, DeSui Coinflip's builders said, \"We wanted to show we could deliver at 100 percent uptime and did so during Quest 3.\" The game also saw 320,000 SUI wagered over 30 days.\n\nTaking a different approach, Ethos used Quest 3 to introduce The Collection to artists and users. The Collection serves as a gallery for AI-generated NFT art on Sui, letting artists mint their works while users vote for their favorites with SUI. \"With The Collection, we are building a global platform for creators to compete, vote, and own a piece of AI-generated digital art history,\" said an Ethos representative.\n\nEthos' The Collection provides an AI art generation tool, and offers some suggestions to help artists get started.\n\nDuring Quest 3, The Collection saw the creation of 53,559 unique wallets, 42,930 artworks created, and 19,068 art entries submitted. Users enjoyed the artworks displayed, pledging 256,933.75 SUI overall. \n\nSimilar to The Collection, Poetry in Motion focuses on creativity. Poets express feelings and ideas through a drag-and-drop interface that lets them select and arrange words. \"We built Poetry in Motion using programmable transaction blocks, nested NFTs, and kiosks, and it was impressive to see them all in action,\" said a representative from the build team. Over the duration of the Quest, 28,140 authors created 33,200 poems.\n\nOther projects showcased during Quest 3 include Run Legends, Suilette, Worlds Beyond, and Bushi. Each game contributed a unique experience for users, while delivering unfettered gameplay through Sui's scalability and resilience.\n\nScaling for games\n\nThe gap between the theoretical and practical can be quite large. Sui, however, went under intense development before its Mainnet, and so far proved its ability to handle the kind of heavy transaction load needed to host games. The builders and players tell the story of its resilience and stability.\n\nMore importantly for project business models, Sui's gas fees do not spike as use increases. Its design, proven through six months of Mainnet, lets the network scale to handle increased load, without artificially limiting use by increasing prices.\n\nREAD NEXT\nThe Top 3 Mobile Wallets on Sui\nMobile wallets are crucial to increasing adoption and accessibility.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAY 15, 2024\n5 Games Coming to Sui: A Glimpse into the Future of Gaming\nNew gaming experiences are created on Sui and numerous games are launching this year!\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 22, 2024\nDive into Sui Overflow: Sui’s First Global Hackathon\nJoin us at Sui Overflow to push the boundaries of what is possible in Web3.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 20, 2024\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

      "html": "Sui.io\nHome\nAbout\nContribute an Article\nEVENTS\nSui Shakes Up Blockchain Industry at Basecamp 2024\nSui Foundation\nApr 18, 2024\n5 min\n\nSui Basecamp was the biggest event for the Sui community, including the builders, developers, partners, investors, and companies working with the most advanced blockchain in history.\n\nSui Mainnet launched last year, and community events around the world helped builders understand the potential for this groundbreaking blockchain technology, but Sui Basecamp showed that Sui has truly arrived. \n\nOver 1,100 people from 65 countries attended Sui's global event, held in Paris this year, to find how Sui established itself firmly in gaming and DeFi. Over two days, the community heard from over 100 speakers in 44 sessions. Major announcements from companies such as Playtron, NHN, and First Digital complemented Sui's meteoric growth in trading volume and Total Value Locked (TVL).\n\n“We are not just here to build a blockchain, we’re not just here to build decentralized software,\" said Evan Cheng, Mysten Labs CEO and co-founder during his Sui Basecamp keynote. \"Why we are all here today is to fundamentally reimagine human and software interaction.\"\n\nThe event featured announcements about how Sui's already blistering speed and mainstream accessibility will become even greater. Already capable of record-breaking transactions-per-second (TPS), further consensus innovation promises to outstrip anything in the industry. And Mysten Lab's Enoki gives non-blockchain companies the simplest path to take advantage of concepts such as digital ownership and verifiable asset data.\n\nMeltem Demirors, blockchain expert and self-proclaimed Aspiring Cult Leader, gave a talk titled \"The trillion dollar whale: bringing atoms and electrons onchain.\"\n\nThe community's excitement at Basecamp 2024 was palpable, as attendees learned about all the exciting things to come, gained inspiration about what they could build, and met face-to-face, many for the first time.\n\nBreaking boundaries\n\nBlockchains from Bitcoin to Solana and Ethereum solved the general problem of decentralized transactions, but Sui arrives with a truly modern network environment capable of supporting enterprise apps and frameworks. Sui's object-oriented data structure lets developers create real apps to engage and delight users, on a scalable network that handles ever increasing traffic. \n\nUnlike traditional enterprise networks, the Move programming language allows for secure smart contract code. These building blocks lead to a future that lets code replace intermediaries and institutions as the global coordinating mechanism of intelligent assets.  \n\nGreg Siourounis, Managing Director of the Sui Foundation, greets Sui Basecamp attendees.\n\nMysticeti, a new technology developed at Mysten Labs by founding members of Sui, makes consensus on the network even more performant. Announced at Basecamp 2024, Mysticeti redesigns the already innovative Bullshark and Narwhal-based consensus engine to further remove latency, allowing transactions to finalize at speeds more than sufficient for the most demanding enterprise and financial frameworks. \n\n“In practice, we’ve implemented Mysticeti to mimic the Sui Maninet environment, and we’ve achieved about 390 milliseconds consensus,\" said Dmitri Perelman, Mysten Labs Head of Engineering. \"As far as we know, this is the fastest achieved settlement finality.”\n\nMysten Labs went one further, announcing Enoki, a new service platform letting Web2 companies realize the benefits of the blockchain. These services, such as zkLogin's effortless onboarding and sponsored transactions, remove the friction caused by legacy blockchain requirements. Leveraging Enoki, companies will be able to integrate Sui's smart contract and digital asset technology into their customer applications, offering extensive new capabilities and services.\n\nEmpowering industries \n\nIn less than one year as a production network, the fact that Sui already made its mark in gaming and DeFi was clear from the companies presenting and exhibiting at Sui Basecamp. Sui's DeFi growth has been nothing short of phenomenal, nearing $700 million TVL in under a year. DeFi protocols such as Navi, Scallop, Turbos, and Bluefin show breathtaking volume on a daily basis. \n\nSui Basecamp attendees from 65 countries had the opportunity to meet each other face-to-face, many for the first time.\n\nCementing Sui as the network for stable DeFi growth, First Digital announced it would bring FDUSD, its $3.3 billion stablecoin, over to Sui in a native format. This new stablecoin gives Sui DeFi users a non-volatile trading option where they can store value. The First Digital announcement joined a pre-Basecamp announcement that DeepBook, Sui's native liquidity layer, would launch its own token, DEEP, later this year.\n\n“As a new company, we feel that the industry is going to change, and that newer protocols like Sui will overtake established protocols,” said Vincent Chok, First Digital's founder and CEO. “We want to have a $10 billion market cap by the end of 2024, with $1 billion on Sui by the end of the year.”\n\nThe Gaming Arcade situated in the Sui Basecamp venue showed that gaming studios have a bright future on Sui. The network's transactional speed and scalability deliver the missing pieces games have needed to succeed in Web3. The Gaming Arcade offered attendees the opportunity to try out new games, such as Panzerdogs and E4C: Fallen Arena, currently available and soon to launch on Sui. New partners NHN and Baby Shark, already giants in gaming, were on hand to show why they chose Sui for their initial blockchain efforts.\n\nAdeniyi Abiodun, CPO and co-founder of Mysten Labs talked about Sui's strengths and introduced Playtron's new SuiPlay0X1 mobile gaming device.\n\nMaking its handheld gaming device debut soon after coming out of stealth at the Game Developers Conference and Sui Gaming Summit last month, Playtron joined Adeniyi Abiodun, CPO and co-founder of Mysten Labs to announce SuiPlay0X1. This gaming deck runs the company's lightweight games-focused operating system and integrates directly with Sui. It will fuel onchain games, giving players immediate access to a wide variety of experiences. \n\n“Web3’s iPhone moment is not an iPhone,” said Playtron CEO Kirt McMaster of the new handheld.\n\nThe SuiPlay0X1, a new mobile gaming device from Playtron, integrates Sui, letting users play onchain games.\nFor the community\n\nLike a bullet train gathering momentum, builders around the world began learning about Sui last year, exploring its capabilities and imagining what they could create. They attended Builder Houses, Sui Connect events, seminars, and meet-ups, a communal understanding experience letting them push the envelope of what an object can be, how smart contracts can enact policies, and where dynamic fields can take their apps.\n\nFud the Pug made a rare IRL appearance at Sui Basecamp.\n\nThe palpable energy at Sui Basecamp between new startups, existing companies discovering blockchain, and individual developers showed the Sui bullet train is up to speed. \n\nWe want to thank all who attended and made it such a stellar event, and invite all builders who want to engage with the new generation of secure network computing to join us at future events and engage with Sui. \n\nREAD NEXT\nDive into Sui Overflow: Sui’s First Global Hackathon\nJoin us at Sui Overflow to push the boundaries of what is possible in Web3.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 20, 2024\nGames on Sui Handle Millions of Transactions During Quest 3\nSui's scalability and resilience delivers seamless gameplay under heavy demand.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nNOV 15, 2023\nSui Hackathon Winners Build On-Chain Item Verification and an Improved Dutch Auction\nStudents from across Europe submitted a variety of projects showing Sui's potential over the weekend of October 21 to 22.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nNOV 9, 2023\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

      "html": "Sui.io\nHome\nAbout\nContribute an Article\nCRYPTOGRAPHY\nzkLogin Adds Multi-sig Recovery, Apple Credentials\nSui Foundation\nMay 9, 2024\n2 min\n\nAn update to zkLogin further extends its capabilities, giving users new options and adding use cases.\n\nContinuing work on zkLogin, Sui's social login primitive, resulted in two significant improvements, multi-signature recovery and support for Apple accounts. These changes allow greater choice for users and a powerful new way to recover accounts if the zkLogin credential issuer or app is no longer active.\n\nThanks to Sui’s cryptographic agility, zkLogin lets builders integrate social logins with their apps. Instead of requiring users to connect a wallet or manually create a new account, apps using zkLogin offer users the ability to create a Sui address with an existing account from companies such as Google and Facebook. The zero knowledge proof technology behind zkLogin eliminates the need for the user to handle any cryptographic sensitive material, such as the private key.\n\nWhen zkLogin launched last year, it supported Google, Twitch, and Facebook accounts. The addition of Apple support helps users who prefer to stick with Apple for all their social logins. This new authentication method particularly benefits iOS users, as it allows iPhone apps to easily support Sui wallet creation. \n\nMulti-signature, or multi-sig, opens up a new means of account recovery geared towards both security and ease of use. As zkLogin assumes the liveliness of the application client ID and its issuer, such as Google, multi-sig provides significant improvements to the recoverability of a zkLogin account.\n\nBy creating a multi-sig wallet with zkLogin and another private key as backup, a user can still access their wallet if the original app or credential issuer goes away. If a builder, for example, takes down their app which included accounts created through zkLogin, users could enter their private key and recover any assets they had in that account, moving them to another wallet.\n\nThe integration of multi-sig with zkLogin also opens the door to more complex use cases, where builders can include up to 10 zkLogin accounts among different credential providers, with customizable weights and thresholds. \n\nFor example, a multi-sig address with a threshold of two could include multiple public keys with different weights. The original owner's Google account could be given a weight of two in this multi-sig scheme and additional signatures, a separate Apple account and a Facebook account, could each be assigned a weight of one. The threshold of two means the Google account, because it has been assigned a weight of two, can always open the multi-sig account by itself. The Apple and Facebook accounts, however, would both be needed to open the multi-sig account, as each by itself does not meet the threshold requirement. \n\nThese updates to zkLogin support overall work on making Sui the most widely accessible blockchain. Creating mass user adoption brings the benefits of digital asset ownership to the world at large.\n\nStart building on Sui and onboard the next generation of blockchain users.\n\nREAD NEXT\nFirst Digital Stablecoin Debuting on Sui\nFDUSD, a stablecoin previously only offered on Ethereum and BNB Chain, expands its horizons on Sui.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 11, 2024\nMysticeti Set to Supercharge Consensus on Sui\nA new design for blockchain consensus reduces latency below Sui's already record-breaking speeds.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 10, 2024\nDeepBook Previews Token Launch with NFT Airdrop\nDeepBook NFT recipients will be able to claim the DEEP token when it launches.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 2, 2024\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

      "html": "Sui.io\nHome\nAbout\nContribute an Article\nMOVE\nHow to Verify if an Address is Multi-Sig Inside Sui Smart Contracts\nMysten Labs\nMay 10, 2024\n7 min\n\nEnable secure accounts accessible by multiple people through a multi-signature contract.\n\nMulti-signature (multi-sig) wallets and accounts allow for enhanced key management by enabling either multiple parties to access shared assets under predefined conditions, or a single user to implement additional security measures. For example, a multi-sig wallet could be used to manage a decentralized autonomous organization’s (DAO) treasury, requiring consent from a certain percentage of members before executing transactions, or it could serve an individual seeking extra protection by distributing access across multiple devices or locations.\n\nSui native multi-sig wallets offer a plethora of applications. They can be used to create interactive game elements or commerce platforms that necessitate collective user actions for access. Establishing a user quorum or other conditions for access ensures that digital assets remain protected against unauthorized use by any individual key/member.\n\nThe Sui Move multi-sig smart contract detailed in this article confirms whether a Sui address is multi-sig and accommodates various key combinations, such as 2-of-3 or any M-of-N. Integrating multisig functionality directly into smart contracts, rather than through SDKs, provides distinct benefits. This method grants developers precise control over access and authorization within the contract’s logic, allowing them to stipulate specific conditions—like signatures from a designated subset of addresses—before permitting function execution. Such detailed control bolsters security by guarding against unsanctioned changes to the contract or asset transfers.\n\nIncorporating multi-sig directly into smart contracts is pivotal for creating secure and resilient applications with adaptable governance models. This fosters a foundation of trust and cooperation within decentralized networks.\n\nOn-chain multi-sig is crucial because it offers transparency and verifiability in decentralized operations. It ensures that actions, such as executing smart contract functions, are only performed when they meet the agreed-upon criteria among stakeholders. For example, knowing if the caller of a smart contract function is a multi-sig address allows for the implementation of nuanced constraints. If a transaction is signed by 3 out of 5 members, up to 1,000 coins could be moved. Conversely, if only 1 out of 5 members signs, the transaction limit could be set to 100 coins. This flexibility in setting transaction thresholds based on the level of consensus provides a balance between security and functionality, making on-chain multisig an indispensable feature for collective asset management and decision-making in the blockchain space.\n\nCreating and using the multi-sig checker contract in Move\n\nA multi-sig address is a special type of address that requires multiple signatures to authorize a transaction. A multi-sig checker smart contract derives a multi-sig address from a set of public keys, weights, and a threshold, and compares it with an expected address. \n\nMulti-sig addresses require multiple signatures to authorize a transaction. They are often used to enhance the security of funds by distributing control among multiple parties. For example, a 2-of-3 multi-sig address requires at least two out of three signers to approve a transaction. Multi-sig addresses can also be used for governance, escrow, or backup purposes.\n\nThe multi-sig smart contract performs three functions:\n\nIt derives multi-sig addresses\nIt verifies multi-sig addresses\nIt can check if a sender is a multi-sig address\nDerive multi-sig addresses\n\nThe multisig module defines the derive_multisig_address_quiet which takes three parameters: pks, weights, and threshold. \n\nThe pks parameter is a vector of vectors of bytes, representing the public keys of the signers.\n\nThe weights parameter is a vector of bytes, representing the weights of each signer.\n\nThe threshold parameter is a 16-bit unsigned integer, representing the minimum sum of weights required to execute a transaction from the multi-signature address.\n\nThe function returns an address, which is the derived multi-signature address.\n\npublic fun derive_multisig_address_quiet(\n        pks: vector<vector<u8>>,\n        weights: vector<u8>,\n        threshold: u16,\n    ): address {\n\n The function performs the following steps:\n\nIt defines a variable, multiSigFlag, of type 8-bit unsigned integer and assigns it the value 0x03, which is the flag for multi-signature addresses.\n\nlet multiSigFlag = 0x03;\n\nIt creates an empty vector of bytes called hash_data, which will store the data to be hashed.\n\nlet hash_data = vector<u8>[];\n\nIt gets the lengths of the pks and weights vectors and checks that they are equal. If not, it aborts the execution with an error code: ELengthsOfPksAndWeightsAreNotEqual.\n\n  let pks_len = pgs.length();\n  let weights_len = weights.length();\n  assert!(pks_len == weights_len, ELengthsOfPksAndWeightsAreNotEqual);\n\nIt initializes a variable, sum, of type 16-bit unsigned integer and assigns it the value 0. It then loops through the weights vector and adds the values of each element to the sum. It then checks that the threshold is positive and not greater than the sum. If not, it aborts the execution with an error code: EThresholdIsPositiveAndNotGreaterThanTheSumOfWeights.\n\n       let mut sum = 0;\n        let mut i = 0;\n        while (i < weights_len) {\n            let w = weights[i] as u16;\n            sum = sum + w;\n            i = i + 1;\n        };\n        assert!(threshold > 0 && threshold <= sum, EThresholdIsPositiveAndNotGreaterThanTheSumOfWeights);\n\n It pushes the multiSigFlag to the hash_data vector. It then serializes the threshold using the bcs::to_bytes function and appends the result to the hash_data vector.\n\n       hash_data.push_back(multiSigFlag);\n       let threshold_bytes: vector<u8> = bcs::to_bytes(&threshold);\n       hash_data.append(threshold_bytes);\n\n\nIt loops through the pks and weights vectors and appends the elements of each pair to the hash_data vector.\n\n        let mut i = 0;\n        while (i < pks_len) {\n          hash_data.append(pks[i]);\n          hash_data.push_back(weights[i]);\n          i = i + 1;\n        };\n\nIt hashes the hash_data vector using the blake2b256 function and converts the result to an address using the address::from_bytes function. It then assigns the address to a variable, ms_address, and returns it.\n\n        let ms_address = address::from_bytes(blake2b256(&hash_data));\n        ms_address\n    }\n\nIt derives a multi-sig address and returns the multi-sig address.\n\nVerifying multi-sig addresses\n\nThe multisig module also defines the check_multisig_address_eq, which checks if the created multi-sig address matches the expected address. As we mentioned above, a multi-sig address is a special type of address that requires multiple signatures to authorize a transaction. A multi-sig address is defined by a set of public keys, weights, and a threshold.\n\nThe function check_multisig_address_eq takes four parameters: pks, weights, threshold, and expected_address. The first three parameters are the same as the ones we used in the previous function, derive_multisig_address_quiet. The last parameter, expected_address, is an address value that we want to compare with the multi-sig address.\n\n   public entry fun check_multisig_address_eq(\n        pks: vector<vector<u8>>,\n        weights: vector<u8>,\n        threshold: u16,\n        expected_address: address,\n    ): bool {\n\nThe function first calls the function, derive_multisig_address_quiet, which creates a multi-sig address from the given public keys, weights, and threshold. This function uses a hash-based algorithm to combine the public keys and the threshold into a 16-byte value, which is then converted into an address.\n\nlet ms_address = derive_multisig_address_quiet(pks, weights, threshold);\n\n The function then compares the multi-sig address with the expected address and returns true if the addresses are equal, and false otherwise.\n\nreturn (ms_address == expected_address)\n\nThe function check_multisig_address_eq can be used to verify that a multi-sig address is correct and matches the expected value. This can be useful for testing, debugging, or auditing purposes. For example, one could use this function to check that a multi-sig address is consistent with the public keys and the threshold that were agreed upon by the signers.\n\nChecking the sender’s multi-sig address\n\nFinally, the multisig module also defines the check_if_sender_is_multisig_address, which checks if the sender is the same multi-sig address that is derived from the provided pks, weights, and threshold.\n\nThe check_if_sender_is_multisig_address takes four parameters: pks, weights, threshold, and ctx. The first three parameters define the multi-sig address scheme, while the last parameter provides the transaction context.\n\nThe pks parameter is a vector of vectors of bytes, representing the public keys of the signers.\n\nThe weights parameter is a vector of bytes, representing the weights of each signer.\n\nThe threshold parameter is a 16-bit unsigned integer, representing the minimum sum of weights required to execute a transaction from the multi-sig address.\n\nFinally, the ctx is a mutable reference to the TxContext, which contains information about the current transaction, such as the sender.\n\n   public fun check_if_sender_is_multisig_address(\n        pks: vector<vector<u8>>,\n        weights: vector<u8>,\n        threshold: u16,\n        ctx: &mut TxContext\n    ): bool {\n\nThe check_if_sender_is_multisig_address function calls the check_multisig_address_eq function, which compares the multi-sig address with the sender address.\n\n       check_multisig_address_eq(pks, weights, threshold, ctx.sender())        \n    }\n\nThe function check_multisig_address_eq returns true if the sender address matches the multi-sig address scheme, and false otherwise.\n\nGet started with multi-sig\n\nMulti-sig addresses are useful for scenarios where there is a need for enhanced security, accountability, or collaboration among multiple parties. Given the valuable digital assets stored on Sui, a multi-sig address can help keep those assets secure.\n\nThe smart contract described in this article can help you get started building applications designed for collaboration and joint custody of assets. As a further resource, you can look at the source code and documentation for this project on GitHub.\n\nREAD NEXT\nLet's Move Sui Helps Developers who want to Move on Sui\nThose wanting to learn Move programming now have a fun and intuitive option with the launch of Let's Move Sui!\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 12, 2024\nAll About Smart Contracts\nIn their simplest form, smart contracts govern transactions, but the Sui Move programming language opens the possibility for much more sophisticated apps.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAUG 30, 2023\nAll About Kiosks\nThe Kiosk primitive on Sui lets builders quickly set up shops and sell digital assets, enforcing policies such as royalties that automatically collect fees for content creators.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAUG 23, 2023\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

Unlike their browser-based counterparts, mobile wallets offer unparalleled accessibility, especially for users who don't have a PC. In Sui, an ecosystem with powerful user-centric and secure primitives such as zkLogin, this significance is magnified. \n\nThree standout Sui mobile wallets have emerged as key leaders, ordered from the longest running to latest addition: Surf Wallet, Nightly, and Sui Wallet. These platforms not only redefine the boundaries of functionality and ease of use but also serve as catalysts for the ecosystem's growth and evolution.\n\nSurf Wallet\n\nAs the first mobile wallet to implement zkLogin, Surf Wallet stands as a trailblazer in the landscape of mobile wallets on Sui. Its distinction lies not only in its ambition to lead in adopting powerful new Sui technology but also in its status as one of the first mobile wallets on Sui. \n\nSurf Wallet boasts a sleek and intuitive interface, ensuring seamless navigation for users. The embedded browser for apps adds an extra layer of convenience, allowing for easy access to DeFi and other services within the Sui ecosystem. \n\nSurf wallet offers a user friendly interface allowing users to explore various apps on Sui.\n\n Check out Surf Wallet for Android and iOS.\n\nNightly\n\nAs the landscape of blockchain technologies continues to expand, Nightly stands out by offering multichain asset management capabilities. Nightly allows users to access assets and apps on multiple chains while seamlessly switching between networks, offering users flexibility in managing their digital assets across multiple ecosystems.\n\nNightly extends its functionality beyond simply managing tokens but also allowing for mobile NFT transfers. Whether you're a collector of NFTs and other Sui assets or a user looking to operate across multiple chains, Nightly offers a convenient platform tailored to every role and requirement in between.\n\nNightly allows for users to manage multiple assets in an easy to use way.\n\nCheck out Nightly for Android and iOS.\n\nSui Wallet\n\nAs the newest addition to the Sui mobile wallet landscape, Sui Wallet has quickly garnered attention for its innovative features and user-centric design. Sui Wallet introduces zkLogin functionality that transcends platform boundaries, offering users a seamless authentication experience across various devices and services. For example, using zkLogin on both the mobile and browser extension of Sui Wallet allows users to access the same wallet without any workarounds. \n\nWith its emphasis on simplicity and elegance, Sui Wallet offers a clean interface that prioritizes user experience. The embedded browser for apps further enhances its utility, providing users with effortless access to a diverse array of services within the Sui ecosystem.\n\nSui Wallet ensures that all actions a user needs to perform is straightforward and easy.\n\nCheck out Sui Wallet for Android and iOS.\n\nNavigating DeFi with Sui mobile wallets\n\nMobile wallets have emerged as indispensable tools for increasing adoption of blockchain networks and apps for any ecosystem. They epitomize the blockchain philosophy of fairness and inclusion by enabling a global audience, which is more likely to have phones than PC access, to make use of blockchain transactions. \n\nWithin Sui, Surf Wallet, Nightly, and Sui Wallet stand as great examples of innovative wallet solutions, offering users a gateway to seamless transactions and enhanced security.\n\nWhether you're a seasoned crypto enthusiast or just beginning the journey, these mobile wallets provide functionality, convenience, and security that all users appreciate and need. As the landscape continues to evolve, the importance of a powerful mobile wallet experience will become increasingly important as they are crucial tools empowering users to embrace the future of finance with confidence and ease.\n\nNote: This content is for general educational and informational purposes only and should not be construed or relied upon as an endorsement or recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any asset, investment or financial product and does not constitute financial, legal, or tax advice.\n\nREAD NEXT\nMysticeti Set to Supercharge Consensus on Sui\nA new design for blockchain consensus reduces latency below Sui's already record-breaking speeds.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nAPR 10, 2024\nTencent Blockchain RPC Service Now Supports Sui\nSui developers will find a variety of plans supporting apps of all sizes.\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 28, 2024\n5 Games Coming to Sui: A Glimpse into the Future of Gaming\nNew gaming experiences are created on Sui and numerous games are launching this year!\nSUI FOUNDATION\nMAR 22, 2024\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.

These articles should cover topics useful to the Sui community.\n\nThe Sui Foundation serves as a representative to the community building and using the Sui network. An essential function of the community involves sharing information and expertise about Sui. To further this aim, the Sui Foundation blog presents the opportunity for community members to contribute articles.\n\nArticles we publish cover topics that are generally useful to the community, including app architecture and coding tips, well-formulated ideas about web3, and other useful information about the Sui network. We do not publish contributed articles intended to promote apps or services on the Sui network.\n\nOnce we have accepted an article idea, we will contact the contributor and develop an outline. After the outline is complete, the contributor writes a first draft of the article. When we receive the first draft, we begin editing the article, then share it with the contributor for a review. This entire process may take a few weeks. In addition, each article idea enters a queue and we may not begin this process for additional weeks, depending on how many article ideas have been received.\n\nWe also may reject article ideas if they do not meet our standards.\n\nPlease fill out our co-marketing request form to submit your idea.\n\nWe will engage with you to help write the article and publish it on the Sui Foundation blog.\n\nSui.io\nThe Sui Blog © 2024.
